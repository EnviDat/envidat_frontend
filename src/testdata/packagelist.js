                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

The data contains the official statistics of the FOEN on fatalities due to flood, debris flow, landslide, rock fall and avalanche.\r\n\r\n__Restrictions: The data set is not complete.__ Only fatalities in or around settlements and on open transportation routes are included. More precisely, fatalities were not collected, when persons exposed themselves to a great danger on purpose. Or fatalities during leisure activities which are connected to a higher risk were not included (this includes e.g. canoeing or river surfing during flood, canyoning, mountaineering, climbing, walking or driving on a closed road).\r\n\r\nFatalities by avalanches are collected at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF. You can download the avalanche fatalities per hydrological year [here](https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/avalanche-fatalities-switzerland-1936) and per calendar year [here](https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/avalanche-fatalities-per-calendar-year-since-1936). For a direct comparison with the fatalities presented here, please download the data set with the calendar years and do not consider fatalities in the backcountry (tour) or in terrain close to ski areas (offpiste).\r\n",

            "notes": "High quality meteorological data are needed for long-term forest ecosystem research, particularly in the light of global change. The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Beatenberg in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural coniferous forest (BAB) with Norway spruce (_Picea abies_; 190-210 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, BAF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Beatenberg is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the\r\nSwiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Bettlachstock in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural mixed forest stand (BTB) with European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_; 170-190 yrs), European silver fir (_Abies alba_; 190 yrs) and Norway spruce (_Picea abies_; 200 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, BTF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Bettlachstock is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, CLF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed.

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Vordemwald in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural mixed forest stand (VOB) with European silver fir (_Abies alba_; 110 yrs) and oak trees (_Quercus sp._; 190-210 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, VOF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Vordemwald is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Visp in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural mixed forest stand (VSB) with Scots pine (_Pinus sylvestris_; 40-80 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, VSF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Visp is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, SCF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed.

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Othmarsingen in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural deciduous forest stand (OTB) with European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_; 120-140 yrs) and lime trees (_Tilia sp._; 120-140 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, OTF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Othmarsingen is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Novaggio in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural deciduous forest stand (NOB) with Turkey oak (_Quercus cerris_; 70 yrs), sweet chestnut (_Castanea sativa_; 90 yrs) and silver birch (_Betula pendula_; 70 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, NOF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Novaggio is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Lausanne in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural mixed forest stand (LAB) with European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_; 160-170 yrs), European silver fir (_Abies alba_; 160-170 yrs) and Norway spruce (_Picea abies_; 160-170 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, LAF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Lausanne is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Nationalpark in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural coniferous forest stand (NAB) with mountain pine (_Pinus mugo_; 210 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, NAF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Nationalpark is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.\r\n",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Jussy in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural broad-leaved forest stand (JUB) with sessile oak (_Quercus petrea_; 90 yrs), aspen (_Populus tremula_; 60 yrs) and European hornbeam (_Carpinus betulus_; 60 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, JUF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Jussy is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, ISF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed.

We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Chironico in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural coniferous forest stand (CIB) with Norway spruce (_Picea abies_; 160-180 yrs) and European silver fir (_Abies alba_; 140-160 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, CIF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Chironico is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The long-term data series published here comprises almost 20 years of measurements for two meteorological stations in Neunkirch in Switzerland where one station is located within a natural deciduous forest stand (NEB) with European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_; 160 yrs), sycamore maple (_Acer pseudoplatanus_; 160 yrs) and lime trees (_Tilia sp._; 110 yrs) as dominant tree species. A second station is situated in the very vicinity outside of the forest (field station, NEF). The meteorological time series are presented in hourly time resolution of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and wind speed. Neunkirch is part of the Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research Programme (LWF) established and maintained by the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

The station metadata (for example location, elevation, measurement start date) from each country was provided by one or several institutions responsible for snow observations. By answering the questionnaire the contacts agreed that the information and metadata provided could be presented in the ESB. For cases where institutions indicated that information on station locations could be made publicly available, the metadata for the variables snow depth (HS), depth of snowfall (HN) and water equivalent of the snow cover (SWE), is additionally provided here for download (METADATA.xlsx).\r\nPlease note that not all institutions gave permission to publish their station metadata. This metadata has to be requested from the non-personal institution contacts provided in the METADATA.xlsx file. In some cases, however, no institutional contact is available and thus the contact of the country representative who filled in the questionnaire is used. \r\nFor current, updated station metadata we refer to the (non-personal) institutional contacts provided in METADATA.xlsx and/or the institution webpages. Note, however, that we cannot guarantee for completeness of the dataset for all countries because operational networks are prone to changes.",

            "notes": "The European Snow Booklet (ESB) is a book of reference for snow measurements that has been produced through collaboration with many European snow practitioners and snow scientists in the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1404 “A European network for a harmonised monitoring of snow for the benefit of climate change scenarios, hydrology and numerical weather prediction (HarmoSnow)”. The ESB provides a unique collection of information about operational snow observations in the European countries and the methods used to perform basic measurements of snow on the ground: snow depth (HS), depth of snowfall (HN), water equivalent of the snow cover (SWE) and presence of snow on the ground (PSG). Information and station metadata (for example location, elevation) for these basic snow variables were collected through a comprehensive survey, the ESB questionnaire between August 2017 and March 2018. Numerous institutions of 38 European countries provided detailed information describing the status of the operational snow observations and the methods used at the time of the survey. Based on the information provided, a country report was written for each European country. Similarities and differences among the countries, that is, the choice of snow variables to be measured, the measurement principles applied, the number of stations, or the spatial and elevational station distribution are pointed out. Thus the collection of country reports demonstrates the relevance of snow measurements for each country. Thus, the intention of the ESB is to foster better knowledge transfer regarding snow measurements between the snow science and operational communities and to improve the communication of information to the general public.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information on the European countries, we refer to the ESB, which can be downloaded here (envidat.ch). Please note that the ESB is not a living document and information and station metadata are from August 2017 till March 2018, except for Latvia (metadata updated in December 2018).",

When using this data and R scripts the above publication should be cited. \r\n\r\nThe interaction of habitat dynamics with species dispersal abilities could generate gradients\r\nin species diversity and prevalence of life-history and ecological traits, when the latter are associated with dispersal potential. In this dataset, we use a spatial mechanistic model of speciation, extinction and dispersal, constrained by a dispersal parameter. This model allows to simulate the interplay between reef habitat dynamics over the past 140 million years and dispersal, shaping lineage diversification history and global assemblage composition of over 6000 tropical reef fish species. Global trait distribution data of tropical reef fish are used to evaluate the congruence between simulations and observations.",

            "notes": "The colonization of cut pine stems by wood-inhabiting insects was investigated at various elevations. The study sites were located in the regions of Aosta Valley (Italy), Valais (Switzerland), and Grisons (Switzerland). In each region, there were two gradients in pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, with three study sites at 900 m, 1200 m, and 1600 m a.s.l. each. Vital trees were felled in late autumn and the stems were colonized by pioneering xylophagous insects and their natural enemies next spring. Pieces of these stems were cut and exposed in emergence traps in a greenhouse. In each region the survey was done in two consecutive years.\r\n\r\nPlease contact author for terms of use.",

An adequate documentation of the data quality and its history finally enables users to work responsibly with these data.\r\n\r\nAs the research community gets closer and the sharing of data becomes more common and important a simple and intuitive access to these environmental data is a key factor in large projects. Methods of spatial information analysis allow to build and link complex process models of different scientific fields.\r\n\r\n###Tasks and main research\r\n\r\n* Developing innovative methods to store the history, quality and accuracy of spatial & temporal data (event oriented spatial databases), developing and implementing a method database, particularly in the context of the projects National Forest Inventory NFI and Datacenter Nature and Landscape DNL\r\n* Analysing spatial and temporal data and modelling natural phenomena and processes\r\n* Developing algorithms for open and intuitive search in geo-databases (e.g. ontologies)\r\n* Developing and implementing concepts to provide spatially distributed geographic information (virtual database)\r\n* Developing methods to handle the uncertainties and inaccuracies (due to measurement and spatial resolution) of spatial data when used in models\r\n* Maintaining and advancing the NFI-database and the Datacenter Nature and Landscape (DNL), developing software for the NFI and DNL\r\n* Maintaining and advancing the Geographical Information System of the WSL\r\n* Knowledge transfer at university level, mainly through teaching positions, support and supervision of Master- and PhD-theses in the main topics of the GIS-Group\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/forest-resources-and-management/gis.html",

            "notes": "This dataset contains open vector data for railways, forests and power lines, as well an open digital elevation model (DEM) for a small area around a sample forest range in Europe (Germany, Upper Bavaria, Kochel Forest Range, some 70 km south of München, at the edge of Bavarian Alps).\r\nThe purpose of this dataset is to provide a documented sample dataset in order to demonstrate geospatial preprocessing at FOSS4G2019 based on open data and software. This sample has been produced based on several existing open data sources (detailed below), therefore documenting the sources for obtaining some data needed for computations related to forest accessibility and wood harvesting. For example, they can be used with the open methodology and QGIS plugin [Seilaplan]( https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.software.1) for optimising the geometric layout cable roads or with additional open software for computing the forest accessibility for wood harvesting.\r\nThe vector data (railways, forests and power lines) was extracted from OpenStreetMap (data copyrighted OpenStreetMap contributors and available from https://www.openstreetmap.org). The railways and forests were downloaded and extracted on 18.05.2019 using the open sources QGIS (https://www.qgis.org) with the QuickOSM plugin, while the power lines were downloaded a couple of days later on 23.05.2019. \r\n\r\nAdditional notes for vector data: \r\nPlease note that OpenStreeMap data extracts such as forests, roads and railways (except power lines) can also be downloaded in a GIS friendly format (Shapefile) from http://download.geofabrik.de/ or using the QGIS built-in download function for OpenStreetMap data. The most efficient way to retrieve specific OSM tags (such as power=line) is to use the QuickOSM plugin for QGIS (using the Overpass API -  https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) or directly using overpass turbo (https://overpass-turbo.eu/). Finally, the digitised perimeter of the sample forest range is also made available for reproducibility purposes, although any  perimeter or area can be digitised freely using the QGIS editing toolbar.\r\n\r\nThe DEM was originally adapted and modified also with QGIS (https://www.qgis.org) based on the elevation data available from two different sources, by reprojecting and downsampling datasets to 25m then selecting, for each individual raster cell, the elevation value that was closer to the average. These two different elevation sources are:\r\n\r\n- Copernicus Land Monitoring Service - EU-DEM v.1.1 (TILE ID E40N20, downloaded from https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/eu-dem/eu-dem-v1.1; this original DEM was produced by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service “with funding by the European Union” based on SRTM and ASTER GDEM)\r\n- Digitales Geländemodell 50 m Gitterweite (https://opendata.bayern.de/detailansicht/datensatz/digitales-gelaendemodell-50-m-gitterweite/), produced by the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung – www.geodaten.bayern.de –and downloaded from http://www.geodaten.bayern.de/opendata/DGM50/dgm50_epsg4258.tif\r\n\r\nThis methodology was chosen as a way of performing a basic quality check, by comparing the EU-DEM v.1.1 derived from globally available DEM data (such as SRTM) with more authoritative data for the randomly selected region, since using authoritative data is preferred (if open and available). For other sample regions, where authoritative open data is not available, such comparisons cannot longer be performed.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes DEM: a very good DEM open data source for Germany is the open data set collected and resampled by Sonny (sonnyy7@gmail.com) and made available on the Austrian Open Data Portal http://data.opendataportal.at/dataset/dtm-germany. In order to simplify end-to-end reproducibility of the paper planned for FOSS4G2019, we use and distribute an adapted (reprojected and resampled to 25 meters) sample of the above mentioned dataset for the selected forest range.\r\n\r\nThis sample dataset is accompanied by software in Python, as a Jupiter Notebook that generates harmonized output rasters with the same extent from the input data. The extent is given by the polygon vector dataset (Perimeter). These output rasters, such as obstacles, aspect, slope, forest cover, can serve as input data for later computations related to forest accessibility and wood harvesting questions. The obstacles output is obtained by transforming line vector datasets (railway lines, high voltage power lines) to raster. Aspect and slope are both derived from the sample digital elevation model.",

The spherical model snow was generated to create geometrically simplified, well-defined microstructures for calibration of numerical models, such as discrete element models (DEM) in which the microstructure is represented by spherical particles. \r\nIn the experiments, microstructural variation was created by varying the sintering time (contact size) and the density of the ice sphere samples (number of contacts). The 3D CT images allow for a complete reconstruction of the entire experimental sample (cylindrical sample dimension: diameter = 33.6 mm; height = 14 mm). \r\n\r\n",

It was used to develop parsimonious, species-specific mortality models for 18 European tree species based on tree size and growth as well as additional covariates on stand structure and climate. \r\n\r\n## Inventory data\r\nMeasurements had been conducted repeatedly on up to 14 permanent plots per reserve for up to 60 years with re-measurement intervals of 4 - 27 years. The permanent plots vary in size between 0.03 and 3.47 ha. The inventories provide diameter measurements at breast height (DBH) and information on the species and status (alive or dead) of trees with DBH ≥ 4 cm for Switzerland and ≥ 7 cm for Germany. \r\n\r\n## Data selection\r\nWe excluded three permanent plots where at least 80 % of the trees died during an interval of 10 years, and mortality could be clearly assigned to a disturbance agent. Mortality in the remaining stands was rather low, with a mean annual mortality rate of 1.5 % and strong variation between plots from 0 to 6.5 % (assessed for trees of all species with DBH ≥ 7 cm).\r\nWe only used data from permanent plots with at least 20 trees per species to obtain reliable plot-level mortality rates even for species with low mortality rates (about 5 % during 10 years), and selected tree species occurring on at least 10 plots to cover sufficient ecological gradients. This led to a dataset of 197 permanent plots and 18 tree or shrub species: _Abies alba_ Mill., _Acer campestre_ L., _Acer pseudoplatanus_ L., _Alnus incana_ Moench., _Betula pendula_ Roth, _Carpinus betulus_ L., _Cornus mas_ L., _Corylus avellana_ L., _Fagus sylvatica_ L., _Fraxinus excelsior_ L., _Picea abies_ (L.) Karst, _Pinus mugo_ Turra, _Pinus sylvestris_ L., _Quercus pubescens_ Willd., _Quercus_ spp. (_Q. petraea_ Liebl. and _Q. robur_ L.; not properly differentiated in the Swiss inventories), _Sorbus aria_ Crantz, _Tilia cordata_ Mill. and _Ulmus glabra_ Huds.. \r\n\r\n## Predictors of tree mortality\r\nWe considered tree size and growth as key indicators for mortality risk. Radial stem growth between the first and second inventory and DBH at the second inventory were used to predict tree status (alive or dead) at the third inventory. To this end, the annual relative basal area increment (relBAI) was calculated as the compound annual growth rate of the trees basal area. Additional covariates on stand structure and climate comprise mean annual precipitation sum (P), mean annual air temperature (mT), the mean and the interquartile range of DBH (mDBH, iqrDBH), basal area (BA) and the number of trees (N) per hectare. \r\n\r\n## Further information\r\nFor further information, refer to Hülsmann _et al_.

            "notes": "The datasets comprise nearly 19’000 trees of European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_ L.) from unmanaged forests in Switzerland, Germany / Lower Saxony and Ukraine. Tree death was modelled as a function of size and growth, i.e., stem diameter (DBH) and relative basal area increment (relBAI). To explain the spatial and temporal variability in mortality patterns, we considered a large set of environmental and stand characteristics.\r\n\r\n## Inventory data\r\nThe strict forest reserves in Switzerland and Germany had been established in the period of 1961-1975 and 1971-1974, respectively. Every reserve included up to 10 permanent plots ranging from 0.09 to 1.8 ha in size, with slightly irregular re-measurement intervals. Permanent plots with pure or mixed beech stands were selected from the reserves of both networks. Reserves with considerable wind disturbance during the monitored intervals were excluded from the analysis. In addition to data from the Swiss and German reserves, data from a 10 ha plot in the primeval beech forest Uholka in Western Ukraine including three remeasurements were used. The inventory data provide diameter measurements at breast height (dbh) for revisited trees with a diameter of more than 4, 7 and 6 cm for Switzerland, Germany and Ukraine, respectively.\r\n\r\n## Mortality predictors\r\nA set of three consecutive inventories was used to generate records for the calibration of mortality models based on trees that were alive in the first and second inventory and either dead or alive in the third inventory. As an explanatory variable, the annual relative basal area increment (relBAI) was calculated based on the first and the second dbh measurement as the compound annual growth rate of the trees basal area. Tree dbh in the second inventory was used in addition to relBAI to model tree status (alive or dead) of the third inventory. \r\n\r\nTo increase the generality of the mortality models, we selected environmental variables that are known to have a considerable influence on growth and mortality of beech. We emphasized the effects of water availability using a large set of drought characteristics that were calculated based on the local site water balance. We also related beech mortality to soil pH, temperature, precipitation and growing degree-days. Additionally, we considered stand characteristics that reflect the development stage, competition and structure of the forests.\r\n\r\n## Further information\r\nFor further information, refer to Hülsmann _et al_.

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

                "description": "Our research explores environmental systems, often using approaches developed in physics.  Environmental systems often encompass physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous on all scales, and poorly characterized by direct measurement.  Thus we often need to try to understand these systems by cleverly analyzing how they behave, and by probing their inner workings using carefully designed experiments.  The spatial heterogeneity and process complexity of environmental systems imply that any feasible theory will inevitably involve substantial simplifications and generalizations. The essential question in environmental science is which simplifications and generalizations are the right ones.  We seek to answer questions such as:\r\n\r\n- How does rainfall become runoff?\r\n- How is the chemistry of natural waters shaped by subsurface transport and mixing, by chemical reactions with soils and rocks, and by biological processes?\r\n- Conversely, what can we learn about these processes at the scale of the whole landscape, by observing the signals that they impart to streams?\r\n- What processes control rates and patterns of physical erosion and chemical weathering? And how do they, in turn, regulate the topographic evolution of mountains and valleys, as well as the physical and chemical environment in which we (and all other organisms) live?\r\n\r\nWe explore connections between terrestrial and aquatic environments, and linkages between physical, chemical, and biological processes. Our work typically combines field observations, simple mathematical models, and novel analyses of environmental data. ",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

All data were presented and analyzed in the paper 'Revisiting Snow Cover Variability and Canopy Structure within Forest Stands: Insights from Airborne Lidar Data' (Mazzotti et al., 2019, Water Resources Research). Data were acquired i) within a pilot mission of NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory in the Swiss Alps in March 2017 and ii) during NASA’s SnowEx campaign at Grand Mesa in February 2017. Snow depth maps are available for two dates separated by approx.1 week, and include an area of ca. 0.5km2 for each of the three sites Davos, Engadine and Grand Mesa. \r\n\r\n__Paper Citation:__\r\n > _Giulia Mazzotti; William Ryan Currier; Jeffrey S.

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

The experiment is located in a xeric mature Scots pine forest in the Pfynwald (46° 18' N, 7° 36' E, 615 m a.s.l.) in one of the driest inner-Alpine valleys of the European Alps, the Valais (mean annual temperature: 9.2°C, annual precipitation sum: 657 mm, both 1961-1990). Tree age is on average 100 years, the top height is 10.8 m and the stand density is 730 stems ha-1 with a basal area of 27.3 m2 ha-1. The forest is described as _Erico Pinetum sylvestris_ and the soil is a shallow pararendzina characterized by low water retention. The experimental site (1.2 ha; 800 trees) is split up into eight plots of 1'000 m2 each. During April-October, irrigation is applied on four randomly selected plots with sprinklers of 1 m height at night using water from an adjacent water channel. The amount of irrigation corresponds to a supplementary rainfall of 700 mm year-1. Trees in the other four plots grow under naturally dry conditions. Soil moisture has been monitored since the beginning of the project at 3 soil depths (10, 20 and 60 cm). The crown condition of each tree is being assessed each year since 2003. Tree measurement data such as diameter at breast height, tree height, and social status were assessed in 2002, 2009 and 2014. The duration of the irrigation experiment is planned for 20 years.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994.

            "notes": "Decomposition of plant litter is a key process for the transfer of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Carbon contained in the decaying biomass is released to the atmosphere as respired CO2, and may contribute to global warming. Litterbag studies have been used to improve our knowledge of the drivers of litter decomposition, but they lack comparability because litter quality is plant species-specific. The use of commercial tea bags as a standard substrate was suggested in order to harmonize studies, where green tea and rooibos represent more labile and more recalcitrant C compounds as surrogates of local litter.\r\nThe tea bag approach was implemented on eight sites of the Swiss long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) network (https://www.wsl.ch/LWF). This allowed us to take advantage from the existing infrastructure and data from a previous litterbag study with local litter. In Beatenberg and Schaenis, additional elevation transects were established (1200-1800 m and 540-1150 m, respectively) to examine particularly the effect of temperature on decomposition. In Pfynwald (https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/flaechen-im-wald/pfynwald.html) and Salgesch, infrastructure of running projects was used to examine the effect of drought and understory removal, respectively. In Novaggio, tea bags were incubated in summer and winter to study the effect of seasonality particularly precipitation. Tea bags are collected after 3, 12, 24, and 36 months; for the two time-shifted experiments additionally after 6 and 9 months.\r\nThe study has two primary objectives. Firstly, it contributes to TeaComposition initiative (http://teacomposition.org/) which aims at investigating long-term litter decomposition and its key drivers at present as well as under different future climate scenarios using a common protocol and standard litter (tea) across nine terrestrial biomes. Secondly, the data are used to further develop decomposition models such as Yasso (http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/yasso) which is used by several countries, including Switzerland to estimate the annual carbon fluxes in dead wood, litter, and soil for reporting in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.\r\n",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

The test site below the building is the [SLF's](http://www.envidat.ch/organization/slf) oldest and equipped with numerous measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n## Globally unrivalled serial measurements\r\nIn autumn 1936, the Expert Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research (now the SLF) in Switzerland built the first snow laboratory on the Weissfluhjoch. Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",

The experimental site at the Weissfluhjoch (WFJ, 46.83 N, 9.81 E) is located at an altitude of 2540 m in the Swiss Alps near Davos. During the winter months, almost all precipitation falls as snow at this altitude. As a consequence, a continuous seasonal snow cover builds up every winter, with a maximum snow height ranging from 153–366 cm over the period 1934–2012. The measurement site is located in an almost flat part of a southeast oriented slope.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n1. Marty, C., Philipona, R., Frohlich, C., Ohmura, A..

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

Three surveys at the Sankt Annafirn allowed for a full glacier coverage,  four  surveys at Griesgletscher allowed an almost full glacier coverage and seven surveys at Findelengletscher allowed for a partial coverage of the glacier tongue (see individual datasets for exact extent). For each survey, a __high resolution orthoimage__ and a __Digital Surface Model (DSM)__ was created.\r\n\r\n### UAV surveys:\r\n\r\nPrior flight, Ground Control Points (GCPs) were deployed on the glacier surface and measured with a differential GPS (Trimble R7 or Leica GPS 1200). They allowed precise georeferencing of the UAV-derived datasets. UAV flight plans were planned with the software *eMotion 2* and a SenseFly eBee was used as surveying platform. The images were then processed with the software Agisoft Photoscan Pro 1.1.6 .\r\n\r\nThe location and dates of each survey can be found in the table together with the number of flights performed (Nflights), the number of acquired images (Nimages), the number of GCPs set (NGCPs) and the surveyed area.\r\n\r\nA folder for each dataset is available (see folder name in table), which contains:\r\n\r\n- An orthoimage  __*glacier_date_photoscan_oi_CH1903+_LV95_0.1m.tif*__\r\n\r\n- A Digital Surface Model  __*glacier_date_photoscan_dsm_CH1903+_LV95_0.1m.tif*__\r\n\r\n- The Agisoft Photoscan automatic processing report   __*glacier_date_photoscan_report.pdf*__\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\n- __*glacier*__ is the name of the surveyed glacier\r\n\r\n- __*date*__ is the date of the UAV image acquisition\r\n\r\n- __*photoscan*__ is the name of the photogrammetric software\r\n\r\n- __*oi*__ or __*dsm*__ the type of dataset\r\n\r\n- __*CH1903+_LV95*__ is the coordinate system and datum of the dataset\r\n\r\n- __*0.1m*__ is the resolution of the dataset in meter\r\n\r\n- __*.tif*__ is the extention of the dataset\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDetails about the UAV surveys, the image processing and the accuracy of the UAV-derived products can be found in this publication below.\r\n\r\n__Paper Citation:__\r\n > _Gindraux et al. 2017.

We mainly investigate species that are relevant for Switzerland owing to their function in ecosystems, their distributional focus or their conservation status. We describe how plants of the Alpine region evolve to adapt to changing environmental conditions (adaptation). As important symbiosis partners of our forest trees, we investigate mycorrhizal fungi, their adaptation to tree partners and local conditions, and their significance for the stability of forest ecosystems in a changing environment. We study what effects the characteristics and configuration of landscape elements impose on the dispersal and the connectivity of organisms and their populations or how land use affects rare species of plants and animals (conservation genetics).",

We concentrate on ecological changes and their causes in different ecosystems and habitat types of Switzerland. We are especially interested in the effects of different management systems, nutrient input, land-use change (e.g. intensification, abandonment), habitat fragmentation as well as climate change on ecosystem state. We base our research on systematically assessed floristic and faunistic biodiversity-data, modelling and remote sensing information.\r\n\r\nWe strongly engage in the monitoring and evaluation of qualitative and quantitative changes in natural or semi-natural habitats of Switzerland as a basis for decision-making in policy and applied nature conservation. In the project \"Effectiveness of Habitat Protection in Switzerland\", commissioned by the Federal Office of Environment BAFU, we concentrate on the habitats of national importance (raised bogs, transitional mires and fens, dry meadows, alluvial zones and amphibian spawning areas), i.e. the \"crown jewelry\" of Swiss nature reserves. Moreover, we share our knowledge on mire protection through consulting activities for the national government and the cantons.",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

The outlines have different attributes described in the data example key (ExampleKey_AvalMapping.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe generation of the data is described in:\r\n\r\nBühler, Y., Hafner, E. D., Zweifel, B., Zesiger, M., and Heisig, H.: Where are the avalanches? Rapid mapping of a large snow avalanche period with optical satellites, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-119, in review, 2019.\r\n\r\nAbstract. \r\nAccurate and timely information on avalanche occurrence are key for avalanche warning, crisis management and avalanche documentation. Today such information is mainly available at isolated locations provided by observers in the field. The achieved reliability considering accuracy, completeness and reliability of the reported avalanche events is limited. In this study we present the spatial continuous mapping of a large avalanche period in January 2018 covering the majority of the Swiss Alps (12’500 km2). \r\n\r\nWe tested different satellite sensors available for rapid mapping during a first avalanche period. Based on these experiences, we tasked SPOT6/7 data for data acquisition to cover the second, much larger avalanche period. We manually mapped the outlines of 18’737 individual avalanche events, applying image enhancement techniques to analyze regions in cast shadow as well as brightly illuminated ones. The resulting dataset of mapped avalanche outlines, having a unique completeness and reliability, is evaluated to produce maps of avalanche occurrence and avalanche size. We validated the mapping of the avalanche outlines using photographs acquired from helicopters just after the avalanche period. \r\n\r\nThis study demonstrates the applicability of optical, very high spatial resolution satellite data to map an exceptional avalanche period with very high completeness, accuracy and reliability over a large region. The generated avalanche data is of great value to validate avalanche bulletins, complete existing avalanche databases and for research applications by enabling meaningful statistics on important avalanche parameters.\r\n\r\nKoordinate System: CH1903+ LV95 LN02",

This research contributes, therefore, to our understanding of the influence of snow and wet or frozen soil on natural hazard generation and on the earth’s climate, and of how global climate change affects alpine permafrost.\r\n\r\nThe experimental methodologies employed by this Research Unit range from using laboratories (CT-Scanning, wind tunnel) to field-scale test sites. A primary output of this research is to improve current community models for climate change analysis and warning applications and to create new models.\r\n\r\nThe unit has its partners and stakeholders in warning and local safety services, the cryospheric scientific community and industry. It collaborates with institutes from EPFL and ETHZ, meteorological and engineering university institutes worldwide, research organizations and the high performance computing community.",

Lehning, Advances in Water Resources __55__, 4-16, 2013\r\n\r\nA model study on the impact of climate change on snow cover and runoff has been conducted for the Swiss Canton of Graubünden. The model Alpine3D has been forced with the data from 35 Automatic Weather Stations in order to investigate snow and runoff dynamics for the current climate. The data set has then been modified to reflect climate change as predicted for the 2021-2050 and 2070-2095 periods from an ensemble of regional climate models.\r\n\r\nThe predicted changes in snow cover will be moderate for 2021-2050 and become drastic in the second half of the century. Towards the end of the century the snow cover changes will roughly be equivalent to an elevation shift of 800 m. Seasonal snow water equivalents will decrease by one to two thirds and snow seasons will be shortened by five to nine weeks in 2095.\r\n\r\nSmall, higher elevation catchments will show more winter runoff, earlier spring melt peaks and reduced summer runoff. Where glacierized areas exist, the transitional increase in glacier melt will initially offset losses from snow melt. Larger catchments, which reach lower elevations will show much smaller changes since they are already dominated by summer precipitation.",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

For modeling current water supply, observed meteorological time series were used as input, while simulated meteorological time series derived from 39 model chains of the CH2018 initiative were used as an input for simulating future climate conditions.\r\n\r\nWater demand was estimated for six categories: \r\n\r\n- 1) Drinking water (households and tourism),\r\n- 2) industry (second and third sector), \r\n- 3) artificial snow production, \r\n- 4) agriculture (irrigation and livestock feeding), \r\n- 5) ecology (residual flows), and \r\n- 6) hydropower.\r\n\r\nFuture estimates consider changes in demand related to population growth and changes in the hydrological conditions.\r\nStorage volumes are provided for natural lakes (storage capacities and usable volumes), artificial reservoirs, reservoirs for artificial snow production, and drinking reservoirs.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the simulation and estimation procedures can be found in \r\n\r\n*   Brunner, M.I., Björnsen Gurung, A., Zappa, M., Zekollari, H., Farinotti, D., Stähli, M., 2019.

To this end, biomass and cover of the six main plant groups in the herb layer were collected from 405 1x1 m subplots on 135 study sites (15 sites in 9 strata) which were selected based on a stratified sampling approach. To ensure consistency with NFI methodology, study sites corresponded to the design of regular NFI sample plots and plant cover was estimated by trained field-crew members. Based on the dry weight of the plant biomass and the cover estimate on each subplot, a linear regression model was developed and applied to estimate herb layer biomass on each NFI sample plot.",

                "description": "The name Insubria derives from a pre-Roman population occupying the geographical area between the Po River and the Monte Ceneri. In the present time the name is used for indicating the region extending from Lago d'Orta in the West, to Lago di Garda in the East, which is characterized by a mild and wet climate. Due to its particular biogeographical position, this region does not only host a highly diverse flora and fauna with important endemisms, but also a great cultural and historical diversity. In the recent past, the area has been exposed to important socio-cultural changes with dramatic effects on the land use and on the cultural and biological diversity in space and time. For these reasons, Insubria can be considered an ideal model region to assess the effects of global change on cultural and biotic diversity and ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nThe Insubric Ecosystems Group aims understanding the ecological and cultural component of such biogeographic transition regions and their role in driving biological and cultural diversity. Dynamics and changes are investigated from geo-historical perspectives and at different biotic levels (from the species, to the population and community composition) and interpreted in the light of different socio-cultural context.\r\n\r\nMain research topics are the chestnut forests and cultivation, forest fire history and ecology, neophytes, biodiversity in disturbed and urban ecosystems.",

In order to provide a complete range of data covering the entire process from the pest arrival to complete biological control by its natural enemy T. sinensis, a space-for-time substitution approach has been adopted so as to create a temporal gradient of the epidemic stages over the whole study area.\r\n\r\nThe southernmost Swiss sites roughly represent the arrival and establishment of the pest without the presence of the natural enemy, the central ones the early epidemic stage and the epidemic peak, whereas the northern ones the end of the epidemic with the beginning of the biocontrol. The Italian ones represent the beginning of the equilibrium between the two population as well as the situation with stable T. sinensis populations on the long term.\r\n\r\nThese data are used in the paper entitled: Torymus sinensis local and regional early population dynamics in the Insubrian and Piedmont regions\r\n\r\n",

We focus on food webs in real world ecosystems and thus mainly sample our data during experimental field campaigns. Data collection under controlled conditions in the greenhouse or experimental garden are, however, common add-ons hereby. We are mainly interested in the functioning of natural ecosystems and often conduct research in National Parks around the world. Our main study area is, however, the Swiss National Park. While working on basic research questions, we regularly consider applied aspects that are related to protecting or conserving endangered ecosystems.\r\n\r\nExamples of research question of our research group assesses are:\r\n\r\nHow is species loss related to ecosystem processes and functions? Which species or species groups are particularly relevant for ecosystem functioning? Which effects are expected with the loss of such important species groups? How are aboveground organisms interacting with belowground organisms? Which abiotic and biotic conditions favor diverse ecosystems? Is global change (for example eutrophication, habitat fragmentation, climate) a thread for diverse ecosystems? How can diverse ecosystems be protected?",

Size-dependent loss of aboveground animals differentially affects grassland ecosystem coupling and functions. 2018. Nature Communications 9: 3684.  [doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-06105-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06105-4).\r\n\r\nPlease cite this paper together with the citation for the datafile.\r\n\r\n#Methods\r\n##Study sites \r\nThe experimental exclosure setups were installed within the SNP (IUCN category Ia preserve; Dudley 2008), in south-eastern Switzerland. The park covers 172 km2 of forests and subalpine and alpine grasslands along with scattered rock outcrops and scree slopes. The entire area has been protected from human impact (no hunting, fishing, camping or off-trail hiking) since 1914. Large, fairly homogenous patches of short- and tall-grass vegetation, which originate from different historical management and grazing regimes, cover the park’s subalpine grasslands entirely. Short-grass vegetation developed in areas where cattle used to rest (nutrient input) prior to the park’s foundation (14th century to 1914) (Schütz and others 2003, 2006) and is dominated by lawn grass species such as Festuca rubra L., Briza media L. and Agrostis capillaris L. (Schütz and others 2003, 2006). Today, this vegetation type is intensively grazed by diverse vertebrate and invertebrate communities that inhabit the park and consume up to 60% of the available biomass (Risch and others 2013). Tall-grass vegetation developed where cattle formerly grazed, but did not rest, and is dominated by rather nutrient-poor tussocks of Carex sempervirens Vill. and Nardus stricta L. (Schütz and others 2003, 2006). This vegetation type receives considerably less grazing, with only roughly 20% of the biomass consumed (Risch and others 2013). Consequently, the two vegetation types together represent a long-term trajectory of changes in grazing regimes. Underlying bedrock of all grasslands is dolomite, which renders these grasslands rather poor in nutrients regardless of former and current land-use regimes.\r\n##Experimental design\r\nTo progressively exclude aboveground vertebrate and invertebrate animals, we established 18 size-selective exclosure setups (nine in short-grass, nine in tall-grass vegetation) distributed over six subalpine grasslands across the SNP (Risch and others 2013, 2015). Elevation differences of exclosure locations did not exceed 350 m (between 1975 and 2300 m a.s.l.). The exclosures were established immediately after snowmelt in spring 2009 and were left in place for five consecutive growing seasons (until end of 2013). They were, however, temporarily dismantled every fall (late October after first snowfall) to protect them from avalanches. They were re-established in the same location every spring immediately after snowmelt. Each size-selective exclosure setup consisted of five plots (2 x 3 m) that progressively excluded aboveground vertebrates and invertebrates from large to small. The plots are labelled according to the guilds that had access to them “L/M/S/I”, “M/S/I”, “S/I”, “I”, “None”; L = large mammals, M = medium mammals, S = small mammals, I = invertebrates, None = no animals had access. As we only had permission to have the experimental setup in place for five consecutive growing seasons, the experiment had to be completely dismantled in the late fall of 2013 and all material removed from the SNP.\r\nOur exclosure design was aimed at excluding mammalian herbivores, but naturally also excluded the few medium and small mammalian predators, as well as the entire aboveground invertebrate food web. A total of 26 large to small mammal species can be found in the SNP, but large apex predators are missing (wolf, bear, lynx) . Reptiles, amphibians and birds are scarce to absent in the subalpine grasslands under study. Only two reptile species occur in the park and they are confined to rocky areas that warm up enough for them to survive. One frog species spawns in an isolated pond far from our grasslands. Only three bird species occasionally feed on the subalpine grasslands. Using game cameras (Moultrie 6MP Game Spy I-60 Infrared Digital Game Camera, Moultrie Feeders, Alabaster, AL, USA), we did observe that the medium- and small-sized mammals (marmot/hares and mice) were not afraid to enter the fences and feed on their designated plots. We never spotted reptiles, amphibians or birds on camera. We distinguished between 59 higher aboveground-dwelling invertebrate taxa that our size-selective exclosures excluded (see also methods for aboveground-dwelling invertebrates below). \r\nThe “L/M/S/I” plot (not fenced) was located at least 5 m from the 2.1 m tall and 7 x 9 m large main electrical fence that enclosed the other four plots. The bottom wire of this fence was mounted at 0.5 m height and was not electrified to enable safe access for medium and small mammals, while fencing out the large ones. Within each main fence, we randomly established four 2 x 3 m plots separated by 1-m wide walkways from one another and from the main fence line: 1) the “M/S/I” plots were unfenced, allowing access to all but the large mammals; 2) the “S/I” plots (10 x 10 cm electrical mesh fence) excluded all medium-sized mammals. Note that the bottom 10 cm of this fence remained non-electrified to enable safe access for small mammals; 3) the “I” plots (2 x 2 cm metal mesh fence) excluded all mammals. We double-folded the mesh at the bottom 50 cm to reduce the mesh size to smaller than 1 x 1 cm openings; and 4) the “None” plots were surrounded by a 1 m tall mosquito net (1.5 x 2 mm) to exclude all animals. The top of the plot was covered with a mosquito-meshed wooden frame mounted to the corner posts (roof). We treated these plots a few times with biocompatible insecticide (Clean kill original, Eco Belle GmbH, Waldshut-Tiengen, Germany) to remove insects that might have entered during data collection or that hatched from the soil, but amounts were negligible and did not impact soil moisture conditions within these plots.\r\nTo assess whether the design of the “None” exclosure (mesh and roof) affected the response variables within the plots and, therefore, influenced the results, we established an additional six “micro-climate control” exclosures (one in each of the six grasslands) (Risch and others 2013, 2015). These exclosures were built as the “None” exclosures but were open at the bottom (20 cm) of the 3-m side of the fence facing away from the prevailing wind direction to allow invertebrates to enter. A 20-cm high and 3-m long strip of metal mesh was used to block access to small mammals. Thus, this construction allowed a comparable micro-climate to the “None” plots, but also a comparable feeding pressure by invertebrates to the “I” plots. We compared various properties within these exclosures against one another to assess if our construction altered the conditions in the “None” plots. We showed that differences in plant (e.g., vegetation height, aboveground biomass) and soil properties (e.g., soil temperature, moisture) found between the “I” and the “None” treatments were not due to the construction of the “None” exclosure, but a function of animal exclusions, although the amount of UV light reaching the plant canopy was significantly reduced (Risch and others 2013). \r\n##Aboveground invertebrate sampling\r\nAboveground invertebrates were sampled with two different methods to capture both ground- and plant-dwelling organisms: 1) we randomly placed two pitfall traps (67 mm in diameter, covered with a roof) filled with 20% propylene glycol in one 1 x 1 m subplot of the 2 x 3 m treatment plots in spring 2013 (May) and emptied them every two weeks until late September 2013 (Vandegehuchte and others 2017b, 2018). A pitfall trap consisted of a plastic cylinder (13 cm depth, 6.75 cm diameter). Within each cylinder we placed a 100 ml plastic vial with outer diameter 6.70 cm and on top of the cylinder we placed a plastic funnel to guide the invertebrates into the vials. Each trap was cover with a cone-shaped and transparent plastic roof to protect the trap from rain (Vandegehuchte and others 2017b, 2018). Note that in the “None” plots only one trap was placed as control to check for effectiveness of the exclosure. 2) We vacuumed all invertebrates from a 60 x 60 cm area on another 1 x 1 m subplot with a suction sampler (Vortis, Burkhard manufacturing CO, Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK) every month from June to September 2013 (Vandegehuchte and others 2017b, 2018). For this purpose, we quickly placed a square plastic frame (60 x 60 x 40 cm) with a closable mosquito mesh sleeve attached to the top edge into the plot from the outside. The suction sample was then inserted into through the sleeve and operated for 45 s to collect the invertebrates (Vandegehuchte and others 2017b, 2018). \r\nWe sorted the ≈100 000 individuals collected with both methods by hand and identified each individual morphologically to the lowest taxonomic level feasible (59 taxa, including orders, suborders, subfamilies, families; phylum for Mollusca). These taxa belonged to the following feeding types: 19 herbivores, 16 detritivores, 9 predators, 8 mixed feeders, 5 omnivores and 2 non-classified feeders (or not feeding as adults) (Vandegehuchte and others 2017b). We summed the numbers from the two pitfall traps and the suction sampling over the course of the 2013 season to represent the aboveground invertebrate abundance and community composition of a plot. Note: we did not specifically attempt to catch flying invertebrates with e.g., sticky traps, thus a few flying insects may have been missed with our vacuum sampling approach.\r\n##Sampling of plant properties \r\nThe vascular plant species composition was assessed at peak biomass every summer (July) by estimating the frequency of occurrence of each species with the pin count method in each plot (Frank and McNaughton 1990). A total of 172 taxa occurred within our 90 plots and we calculated plant species richness for each plot separately. We used the 2013 data in this study. Plant quality was assessed every year in July and September; here we use plant quality at the end of the experiment (September 2013). Two 10 x 100 cm wide strips of vegetation per plot were clipped, combined, dried at 65°C, and ground (Pulverisette 16, Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) to pass through a 0.5 mm sieve. Twenty randomly selected samples across all treatments were analysed for N (Leco TruSpec Analyser, Leco, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA) (Vandegehuchte and others 2015). Nitrogen concentrations of the other samples were then estimated from models established for the experiment and the entire SNP relating Fourier transform-near infrared reflectance (FT-NIR) spectra to the measured values of N using a multi-purpose FT-NIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Fällanden, Switzerland) (Vandegehuchte and others 2015). Root biomass was sampled every fall by collecting five 2.2 cm diameter x 10 cm deep soil samples (Giddings Machine Company, Windsor, CO, USA) per plot (450 samples year-1). The samples were dried at 30 °C and roots were sorted from the sample by hand. We sorted each sample for 1 h which allowed to retrieve over 90% of all roots present in the samples (Risch and others 2013). The roots were then dried at 65 °C for 48 and weighed to the nearest mg. We averaged the values per plot and used the 2013 data only in this study.\r\n##Sampling of edaphic communities\r\nIn 2009, 2010, and 2011 we collected three composited soil samples (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth; AMS Samplers, American Falls, ID, USA) and assessed bacterial community structure using T-RFLP profiling (Liu and others 1997; Blackwood and others 2003; Hodel and others 2014). We detected a total of 89 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These values are in accordance with other studies reporting OTU richness (Wirthner and others 2011; Zumsteg and others 2012; Meola and others 2014) using T-RFLP profiling, a method that detects the most abundant, and thus likely, the most relevant, taxa. We averaged the data over the three years of collections for our calculations. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was determined with the substrate-induced method (Anderson and Domsch 1978) every fall (September) between 2009 and 2013 by collecting three mineral soil samples (5 cm diameter × 10 cm mineral soil core, AMS Samplers, American Falls, ID, USA). The three samples were combined (90 samples for each sampling year), immediately put on ice, taken to the laboratory, passed through a 2-mm sieve and stored at 4°C. Again, we only used the 2013 data in this study.\r\nSoil samples (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) to extract soil arthropods were collected in June, July, and August 2011 with a soil corer lined with a plastic sleeve to ensure an undisturbed sample (total of 270 samples). The plastic line core was immediately sealed on both ends using cling film and put into a cooler. All plots were sampled within three days and the extraction of arthropods started the evening of the sampling day using a high-gradient Tullgren funnel apparatus (Crossley and Blair 1991; Vandegehuchte and others 2015). Samples were kept in the extractor for four days and the soil arthropods were collected in 95% ethanol. All individuals were counted and each individual was identified morphologically to the lowest level feasible [76 taxa, including orders, suborders, subfamilies, families (Protura, Thysanoptera, Aphidina, Psylina, Coleoptera, Brachycera, Nematocera, Auchenorryncha, Heteroptera, Formicidae); sub-phylum for Myriapoda, for Acari and Collembola also including morpho-species). Note that we also included larval stages (nine of the 76 taxa) (Vandegehuchte and others 2015). All data were summed over the season. A detailed species list for mites and collembolans is published (Vandegehuchte and others 2017a) [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118679.s001]. Earthworms are rare in the SNP and therefore were not included. We collected eight random 2.2 cm diameter x 10 cm deep soil cores from each plot in September 2013 to determine the soil nematode community composition. The samples were mixed and the nematodes were extracted from 100 ml of fresh soil using Oostenbrink elutriators (Oostenbrink 1960). All nematodes in a 1 ml of the 10 ml extract were counted, a minimum of 150 individuals sample-1 were identified to genus or family level using (Bongers 1988), the numbers of all nematodes were extrapolated to the entire sample and expressed for a 100 g dry sample. In total we identified 63 genus or family levels (Vandegehuchte and others 2015). The list of all the nematodes found is published (Vandegehuchte and others 2015) [http://www.oikosjournal.org/appendix/oik-03341] or DOI: [doi: 10.1111/oik.03341]. \r\nWe are aware that sampling soil microbes from 2009 to 2011 and soil arthropods in 2011 was not ideal, but we are positive that this does not bias the results. Most of the parameters measured in our experiment either already showed a treatment response after the first growing season (e.g., plant biomass) or did not respond over the entire time experiment (e.g., microbial biomass C). The microbial community composition (2009 – 2011) was highly influenced by inter-annual differences in temperature and precipitation, but did not differ between treatments or vegetation types (Hodel and others 2014). We therefore felt comfortable using the 2009 through 2011 data for describing the soil microbial community in our experimental treatments. Similarly, we are positive that our soil arthropod data are representative. We did assess soil arthropods in August 2012 and found no differences to the August 2011 data. However, we did not feel comfortable combining the 2011 June, July, August data with only August data for 2012 for our analyses. \r\n##Sampling of soil properties\r\nWe collected three soil samples (5 cm diameter x 10 cm depth) in each plot in September 2013 after removing the vegetation. First, we collected the top layer of mineral soil rich in organic matter, the surface organic layer or rhizosphere, typically 1 to 3 cm in depth with a soil corer (AMS Samples, American Falls, Idaho, USA). Second, we collected a 10 cm mineral soil core beneath this surface layer. The cores for each layer were composited, dried at 65 °C for 48 h and fine-ground to pass a 0.5 mm screen. We then analysed all samples for total C using a Leco TruSpec Analyser (Leco, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA). Mineral soil pH was measured potentiometrically in 1:2 soil:CaCl2 solution with an equilibration time of 30 min. \r\nSoil net N mineralisation was assessed during the 2013 growing season (Risch and others 2015). For this purpose, we randomly collected a 5 cm diameter x10 cm deep soil sample with a soil corer (AMS Samples, American Falls, Idaho, USA) after clipping the vegetation in June 2013. After weighing and sieving (4 mm mesh) the soil, we extracted a 20 g subsample in 1 mol l-1 KCl for 1.5 h on an end-over-end shaker and thereafter filtered it through ashless folded filter paper (DF 5895 150, ALBET LabScience, Hahnenmühle FineArt GmbH, Dassel, Germany). From these filtrates NO3- concentrations were measured colorimetrically (Norman and Stucki 1981) and NH4+with flow injection analysis (FIAS 300, Perkin Elmer, Waltham Massachusetts, USA) (Risch and others 2015). We dried the rest of the sample 105 °C to constant mass to determine fine,fraction bulk density. A second soil sample was collected within each plot in June 2013 with a corer lined with a 5 x 13 cm aluminium cylinder. The corer was driven 11.5 cm deep into the soil so that the top 1.5 cm of the cylinder remained empty. Into this space we placed a polyester bag (250 µm) filled an ion-exchanger resin to capture the incoming N. The bag was filled with a 1:1 mixture of acidic and alkaline exchanger resin (ion-exchanger I KA/ion exchanger IIIAA, Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany). We then removed 1.5 cm soil at the bottom of the cylinder and placed a second resin exchanger bag into this space to capture the N leached from the soil column. To assure that the exchange resin was saturated with H+ and Cl- prior to filling the bags, the mixture was stirred with 1.2 ml l-1 HCl for 1 h and then rinsed with demineralized water until the electrical conductivity of the water reached 5 µm cm-1. The cylinder with the resin bags in place was reinserted into the soil with the top flush to the soil surface and incubated for three months. We recollected the cylinders in September 2013. Each resin bag and 20 g of sieved soil (4 mm mesh) from each cylinder were then separately extracted with KCl and NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were measured. Nitrate and NH4+ concentrations of all samples were then converted to a content basis by multiplying their values with fine fraction bulk density. Net N mineralisation was thereafter calculated as the difference between the N content of the samples collected at the end of the three-month incubation (including the N extracted from the bottom resin bag) and the N content at the beginning of the incubation (Risch and others 2015). \r\nSoil CO2 emissions were measured every two weeks between 0900 and 1700 hrs from early May through late September 2013 with a PP-Systems SRC-1 soil respiration chamber (15 cm high, 10 cm diameter; closed circuit) attached to a PP-Systems EGM-4 infrared gas analyser (PP-Systems, Amesbury, MA, USA) on two locations per plot (Risch and others 2013). The chamber was placed on randomly placed, permanently installed PVC collars (10 cm diameter) driven 5 cm into the soil at the beginning of the study (Risch and others 2013). Freshly germinated plants growing within the collars were removed prior to each measurement to avoid measuring plant respiration or photosynthesis. The two measurements collected per plot and sampling date were averaged. \r\nSoil moisture (with time domain reflectometry; Field-Scout TDR-100, Spectrum Technologies, Plainfield, Illionois, USA) and temperature (with a waterproof digital pocket thermometer; Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa, USA) were measured at five random locations per plot every two weeks during the growing seasons during the experiment for the 0 to 10 cm depth (Risch and others 2013, 2015). As soil moisture and soil temperature were highly negatively correlated (Risch and others 2013), we only used soil moisture for this study. We used plot-level averages of all values available to capture soil moisture variability during the five years of the experiment. The results remained unchanged when we only used soil moisture from the 2013 growing season.\r\n##Numeral calculations and statistical analyses\r\nEcosystem coupling. We conducted principal component analyses (PCAs; unscaled) at the complete dataset level using the abundances of each taxonomical entity to describe each of the five different communities used in this study: aboveground-dwelling invertebrates, vascular plants, soil microorganisms, soil arthropods and soil nematodes. We retained the first two components (PCA axis 1 and PCA axis 2) of each analysis as we found them to adequately represent the temporal and spatial variability of our 90 treatment plots in previous studies55,67. Together they explained a total of 71.70% of the variation for aboveground invertebrates, 44.36% for plants, 44.85% for soil microorganisms, 61.85% for soil arthropods and 77.19% for soil nematodes. In addition, we used soil pH and soil organic C content as a proxy for soil chemical properties, soil bulk density as a proxy for soil physical properties and soil moisture (negatively correlated with soil temperature) as a proxy for soil micro-climatic conditions for an overall total of fourteen constituents.\r\nWe calculated ecosystem coupling9 for each exclosure treatment within each vegetation type (i.e., 2  5 treatment combinations in total) as an integrated measure of pairwise ecological interactions between ecosystem constituents representing ecological communities and the soil abiotic environment. These ecological interactions are defined by non-parametric Spearman rank correlation analyses between two constituents, excluding interactions involving two abiotic constituents (e.g., soil pH vs. soil moisture) and interactions between the first (PC1) and second (PC2) component of each community type, as these are orthogonal by definition. Interactions between abiotic constituents were excluded from the analyses because the focus of our study was on communities and how they interact with one another and their surrounding environment; therefore, including abiotic-abiotic interactions was not of interest here. Given that the effectiveness of our experimental design resulted in that no community composition data of aboveground-dwelling invertebrates was available for the “None” plots (all animals excluded), only thirteen instead of fourteen constituents were included in the ecosystem coupling calculations for this treatment. The complete absence of aboveground invertebrates represents the most extreme case of disturbance between aboveground animal communities and the rest of the ecosystem constituents. This may have resulted in a slight overestimation of ecosystem coupling for these plots. \r\n\tAverage ecosystem coupling was calculated as follows: \r\nEcosystem coupling=\r\nwhere Xi is the absolute Coupling was calculated value of the Spearman’s rho coefficient of the ith correlation for each treatment within each vegetation type (i.e., based on nine replicates each), considering and n is the number of pairwise comparisons considered (n = a total of 80;  interactions (56 in the case of the “None” treatment). We considered a total of 40 biotic-biotic interactions (i.e., concerning two community-level principal components such as plants and microbes; 24 in the case of the “None” treatment) and 40 abiotic-biotic (i.e., concerning one community-level principal component and one abiotic factor, e.g., plant community and soil properties; 32 in the case of the “None” treatment).\tCoupling was calculated for each treatment within each vegetation type (i.e., based on nine replicates each), considering a total of 80 interactions (56 in the case of the “None” treatment). We considered a total of 40 biotic-biotic interactions (i.e., concerning two community-level principal components such as plants and microbes; 24 in the case of the “None” treatment) and 40 abiotic-biotic (i.e., concerning one community-level principal component and one abiotic factor, e.g., plant community and soil properties; 32 in the case of the “None” treatment). \r\nTo establish whether constituents were significantly and positively coupled within treatments (i.e., the average of their correlation coefficients were greater than in a null model where correlation only happens by chance), we calculated one-tailed p-values based on permutation tests with 999 permutations.   \r\n \r\nWe considered six ecosystem functions and process rates commonly used to assess ecosystem functioning (Meyer and others 2015; Manning and others 2018). Plant N content represents a measure of forage quality, while plant richness has been shown to stabilise biomass production, thus allowing the system to respond to changes in herbivory. Soil net N mineralisation, soil respiration, root biomass, and microbial biomass represent fluxes or stocks of energy. For all functions and processes higher values represent higher functioning (Manning and others 2018). All these variables were measured in the last year of the experiment (2013). We then quantified ecosystem multifunctionality using the multiple threshold approach (Byrnes and others 2014; Manning and others 2018), which considers the number of functions that are above a certain threshold, over a series of threshold values (typically 10-99%) that are defined based on the maximum value of each function. We weighted all our functions equally for these calculations (Manning and others 2018). The number of functions in a plot with values higher than a given threshold value for the respective function is summed up. The sum represents ecosystem multifunctionality for that plot. Given that choosing any particular threshold as a measure of ecosystem multifunctionality is arbitrary, we calculated the average of thresholds from 10-90% (in 10% intervals) as a more integrated representation of ecosystem multifunctionality. \r\nWe used Pearson correlations to explore the relationships between ecosystem coupling (all interactions, biotic-biotic interactions, abiotic-biotic interactions involving above- and belowground constituents, and all interactions, biotic-biotic interactions, abiotic-biotic interactions involving belowground constituents only) and ecosystem multifunctionality by calculating the slopes of all relationships between ecosystem coupling and multifunctionality for all thresholds between 10 and 99%. We also related ecosystem coupling with the average of multifunctionality at thresholds between 30-80% as explained before and considered this correlation as a robust indication of the type of association between these two variables. In addition, we explored the relationships between ecosystem coupling (all interactions, biotic-biotic interactions, abiotic-biotic interactions involving above- and belowground constituents, and all interactions, biotic-biotic interactions, abiotic-biotic interactions involving belowground constituents only) and individual ecosystem functions. The effects of exclosures and vegetation type on individual functions and multifunctionality were evaluated using linear mixed effects models ('lme' function of the nlme package), with exclosure and vegetation type as fixed effects and fence as a random factor. All statistical analyses and numerical calculations were done in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team 2016).\r\n\r\n#References\r\n\r\n- Anderson J, Domsch K. 1978.

            "notes": "This dataset contains the output and reference data published in the paper \"Automated snow avalanche release area delineation - validation of existing algorithms and proposition of a new object-based approach for large scale hazard indication mapping\" Yves Bühler, Daniel von Rickenbach, Andreas Stoffel, Stefan Margreth, Lukas Stoffel, Marc Christen (2018) Natural Hazards And Earth System Sciences.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nSnow avalanche hazard is threatening people and infrastructure in all alpine regions with seasonal or permanent snow cover around the globe. Coping with this hazard is a big challenge and during the past centuries, different strategies were developed. Today, in Switzerland, experienced avalanche engineers produce hazard maps with a very high reliability based on avalanche cadastre information, terrain analysis, climatological datasets and numerical modelling of the flow dynamics for selected avalanche tracks that might affect settlements. However, for regions outside the considered settlement areas such area-wide hazard maps are not available mainly because of the too high cost, in Switzerland and in most mountain regions around the world. Therefore, hazard indication maps, even though they are less reliable and less detailed, are often the only spatial planning tool available. To produce meaningful and cost-effective avalanche hazard indication maps over large regions (regional to national scale), automated release area delineation has to be combined with volume estimations and state-of-the-art numerical avalanche simulations.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we validate existing potential release area (PRA) delineation algorithms, published in peer-reviewed journals, that are based on digital terrain models and their derivatives such as slope angle, aspect, roughness and curvature. For validation, we apply avalanche cadastre data from three different ski resorts in the vicinity of Davos, Switzerland, where experienced ski-patrol staff mapped most avalanches in detail since many years. After calculating the best fit input parameters for every tested algorithm, we compare their performance based on the reference datasets. Because all tested algorithms do not provide meaningful delineation between individual potential release areas (PRA), we propose a new algorithm based on object-based image analysis (OBIA). In combination with an automatic procedure to estimate the average release depth (d0), defining the avalanche release volume, this algorithm enables the numerical simulation of thousands of avalanches over large regions applying the well-established avalanche dynamics model RAMMS. We demonstrate this for the region of Davos for two hazard scenarios, frequent (10 – 30 years return period) and extreme (100 – 300 years return period). This approach opens the door for large scale avalanche hazard indication mapping in all regions where high quality and resolution digital terrain models and snow data are available.",

                "description": "We are studying the distribution of and interactions among producers, consumers as well as decomposers and between these communities and their environment. We focus on food webs in real world ecosystems and thus mainly sample our data during experimental field campaigns. Data collection under controlled conditions in the greenhouse or experimental garden are, however, common add-ons hereby. We are mainly interested in the functioning of natural ecosystems and often conduct research in National Parks around the world. Our main study area is, however, the Swiss National Park. While working on basic research questions, we regularly consider applied aspects that are related to protecting or conserving endangered ecosystems.\r\n\r\nExamples of research question of our research group assesses are:\r\n\r\nHow is species loss related to ecosystem processes and functions? Which species or species groups are particularly relevant for ecosystem functioning? Which effects are expected with the loss of such important species groups? How are aboveground organisms interacting with belowground organisms? Which abiotic and biotic conditions favor diverse ecosystems? Is global change (for example eutrophication, habitat fragmentation, climate) a thread for diverse ecosystems? How can diverse ecosystems be protected?",

Does topsoil removal in grassland restoration benefit both soil nematode and plant communities? Journal of Applied Ecology.  [doi:10.16904/envidat.65](https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.65).\r\n\r\nPlease cite this paper together with the citation for the datafile.\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\n## Study area and experimental settings\r\nThe study was conducted in a nature reserve (Eigental: 47° 27’ to 47° 29’ N, 8° 37’ E, 461 to 507 m a.s.l.) that is located on the Swiss Central plateau close to Zurich airport (Canton Zurich, Switzerland). The mean annual temperature in this area ranges from 8.9 to 10.6 °C, mean annual precipitation from 910 to 1260 mm [10-year average (2007-2017); MeteoSchweiz, 2018]. The main soil types are calcaric to gleyic Cambisol and Gleysols. The reserve was established in 1967 to protect small remnants of oligotrophic semi-natural grasslands (roughly 12 ha). The plant community can be characterized as Molinion and Mesobromion (semi-wet to semi-dry), depending on the site-specific groundwater level and slope inclination (Delarze, Gonseth, Eggenberg, & Vust, 2015). These remnants represent species-rich islands in an otherwise intensively managed agricultural landscape. Semi-natural grasslands covered an area of 60,000 ha in the Canton Zurich in 1939, however, by 2005 only roughly 600 ha remained (Baudirektion Kanton Zürich, 2007). In 1990, the government of Canton Zurich decided to enlarge the nature reserve Eigental. The goal was to incorporate eleven patches of 20 ha adjacent intensively farmed land and transform these patches into semi-natural grasslands. The patches had a different agricultural history, ranging from permanent (no tillage for >50 years) to temporary grassland (as part of crop rotation; last tillage <5 years). On all freshly integrated patches fertilization was stopped in 1992 and from then on biomass was harvested three times a year and removed. After 5 years without noticeable effects on vegetation composition, the Nature Conservation Agency of Canton Zurich decided to increase the restoration efforts. In 1995, a large-scale experiment was initialized to evaluate if certain treatments can facilitate restoration within a reasonable timeframe of 5 to 10 years after treatment implementation.\r\nThe three restoration treatments used were: \r\ni. “Harvest only”: Plots are being mowed two to three times a year and the biomass is removed.\r\nii. “Topsoil”: Topsoil was removed to a depth of 10 to 20 cm, depending on the depth of the O and A horizon, in four randomly selected areas within each of the eleven patches in late autumn 1995. The size of each topsoil removal area depended on individual patch size and was between 2700 and 7000 m2. \r\niii. “Topsoil+Propagules”: Propagules from target vegetation were added on half of the area where topsoil was removed, using fresh, seed-containing hay originating from a mixture of semi-dry to semi-wet species-rich grasslands of local provenance (within a radius of 7 km). Hay applications were conducted twice in 1995 and 1996. Repeated applications were chosen to account for the low quantity of available plant material per transfer, since area ratio between receptor and donor sites was roughly 1:1. In addition, hand-collected propagules from 15 selected target species of regional provenance (within a radius of 30 km) were equally applied in 1996 and 1997. \r\n“Topsoil” and “Topsoil+Propagules” plots are mowed once a year, and the biomass is removed. Mowing on these plots started five years after the treatment was implemented. \r\nEleven permanent plots of 5 m x 5 m were randomly established in each treatment to monitor the vegetation development. The experiment was complemented with 11 control plots that represent the initial state of intensively managed grasslands, further referred to as “Initial”, and 11 control plots that represent the targeted state of donor sites for “Topsoil+Propagules”, further referred to as “Target”. Consequently, the experiment consists of 55 plots (5 treatments x 11 replicates). Management of intensively used grasslands includes mowing and fertilizing (manure) between two to five times a year, as well as different tillage regimes (no tillage for >50 years; last time of tillage <5 years). \r\n\r\n## Nematode and plant sampling\r\nSoil nematodes were sampled in 2 m x 2 m plots, randomly established at least 2 m away from the vegetation plots. We collected eight soil cores with a 2.2 cm diameter soil core sampler (Giddings Machine Company, Windsor, CO, USA) to a depth of 12 cm (representing the majority of the plant rooting system) in each plot at the beginning of July 2017. The eight cores within each replicate plot were combined, gently homogenized, placed in coolers and transported to the laboratory of NIOO in Wageningen, the Netherlands, within one week. Free-living nematodes were extracted from 200 g of fresh soil using Oostenbrink elutriator (Oostenbrink, 1960) and concentrated, resulting in 6 mL nematode solution. The nematode solution was subdivided into three subsamples, two for morphological identification and quantification, and one for molecular work (not used in this study). For morphological identification and quantification, nematodes were heat-killed at 90 °C and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde solution (final volume 10 mL per subsample). All nematodes in 1 mL of formaldehyde solution were counted, and a minimum of 150 individuals per 1 mL sample (or all if less nematodes were present) were identified to family level using Bongers (1988). We then extrapolated the numbers of each nematode taxa identified to the entire sample and expressed them per 100 g dry soil for further analyses. \r\nWe calculated number of nematode taxa and Shannon diversity and assessed nematode community composition. In addition, we classified the nematode taxa into feeding types (herbivores, bacterivores, fungivores, omni-carnivores), structural and functional guilds (Table S4). Structural guilds assign nematode taxa according to life-history traits into five colonizer-persister (C-P) classes, ranging from one (early colonizers of new resources) to five (persisters in undisturbed habitats; Bongers 1990). C-P classes can be categorized as indicators for nutrient-enriched (C-P1), stressed (C-P2) and structured (C-P3 + C-P4 + C-P5) soil conditions (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). Functional guilds assign nematode taxa according to their C-P classification combined with their feeding habits (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). Based on the structural and functional guild classification we calculated five additional indices to assess soil nutrient status, disturbance and food web characteristics using NINJA (Sieriebriennikov, Ferris, & de Goede, 2014). 1) The Maturity index indicates the degree of different environmental perturbations (e.g., tillage, nutrient enrichment, pollution) and is used to monitor colonization and subsequent succession after disturbances (Bongers, 1990). 2) The ratio between the Plant Parasite (C-P of herbivorous nematodes only) to Maturity index is used to monitor the recovery of disturbed habitats incorporating information of life-history traits for all feeding types (Bongers, van der Meulen, & Korthals, 1997). 3) The Enrichment index indicates nutrient-enriched soils and agricultural management practices (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). 4) The Structure index provides information about the succession stage of the soil food web and therefore correlates with the degree of maturity of an ecosystem (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). 5) The Channel index provides information about the predominant decomposition pathways, where higher values stand for a higher proportion of energy transformed through the slow fungal decomposition channel (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). In addition, the Structure and Enrichment indices can be displayed in a biplot where nematode assemblages are plotted along a structure (x-axis) and enrichment (y-axis) trajectory (increasing index values). Each biplot quadrat reflects different levels of disturbance, soil nutrient pools and decomposition pathways (Ferris, Bongers, & de Goede, 2001). \r\nThe plant surveys were conducted on the 25 m2 permanent plots in June 2017. Plant species cover was visually assessed according to the semi-quantitative cover-abundance scale of Braun-Blanquet (1964; nomenclature: Lauber & Wagner, 1996). We calculated number of species and Shannon diversity, and assessed plant community composition. We also counted the number of target species (all species recorded in the eleven target plots plus propagules of species applied by hand, resulting in a total of 143 species) and categorized plant species into species of concern based on their red list status in Switzerland as well as their protection status in Switzerland and the Canton Zurich (Moser, Gygax, Bäumler, Wyler, & Palese, 2002). Furthermore, we calculated indicator values for soil moisture and soil nutrients for each species according to Landolt et al. (2010).\r\n\r\n## References\r\nBaudirektion Kanton Zürich (2007). 10 Jahre Naturschutz-Gesamtkonzept für den Kanton Zürich 1995-2005 – Stand der Umsetzung.

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

We provide a deeper insight into the dynamics of sand and snow ejection with a stochastic model derived from the energy and momentum conservation laws. Our analysis highlights that the ejection regime of uniform sand is inherently different from that of heterogeneous sand. Moreover, we show that cohesive snow presents a mixed ejection regime, statistically controlled either by energy or momentum conservation depending on the impact velocity. The proposed formulation can provide a solid base for granular splash simulations in saltation models, leading to more reliable assessments of aeolian transport on Earth and Mars.",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

            "notes": "Preferential deposition of snow and dust over complex terrain is responsible for a wide range of environmental processes, and accounts for a significant source of uncertainty in surface mass balances of cold and arid regions. Despite the growing body of literature on the subject, previous studies reported contradictory results on the location and magnitude of deposition maxima and minima. This study aims at unraveling the  governing processes of preferential deposition in neutrally stable atmosphere and to reconcile seemingly inconsistent results of previous works. For this purpose, a comprehensive modeling approach is developed, based on large eddy simulations of the turbulent airflow, Lagrangian stochastic model of particle trajectories, and immersed-boundary method to represent the underlying topography. The model performance is tested against wind tunnel measurements of dust deposition around isolated and sequential hills. A scale analysis is then performed to investigate the dependence of snowfall deposition on the particle Froude and Stokes numbers, which fully account for the governing processes of inertia, flow advection, and gravity. Additional simulations are performed, to test whether the often used assumption of inertialess particles yields accurate deposition patterns. We finally show that our scale analysis provides qualitatively similar results for hills with different aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains the results of the LES-LSM model. Each Matlab file contains a 2D array of deposition values (in kg/m2) in each surface node (ix, iy) of the Cartesian grid. The file names are consistent with the simulation numbers listed  in the original paper.

            "notes": "Cable-based technologies have been a backbone for harvesting on steep slopes. The layout of a single cable road is challenging because one must identify intermediate support locations and heights that guarantee structural safety and operational efficiency while minimizing set-up and dismantling costs. Seilaplan optimizes the layout of a cable road by\r\nSeilaplan stands for Cable Road Layout Planner. Seilaplan is able to calculate the optimal rope line layout (position and height of the supports) between defined start and end coordinates on the basis of a digital elevation model (DEM).\r\nThe program is designed for Central European conditions and is designed on the basis of a fixed suspension rope anchored at both ends. For the calculation of the properties of the load path curve an iterative method is used, which was described by Zweifel (1960) and was developed especially for standing skylines. When testing the feasibility of the cable line, care is taken that 1) the maximum permissible stresses in the skyline are not exceeded, 2) there is a minimum distance between the load path and the ground and 3) when using a gravitational system, there is a minimum inclination in the load path. The solution is selected which has a minimum number of supports in the first priority and minimizes the support height in the second priority.\r\nThe newly developed method calculates the load path curve and the forces occurring in it more accurately than tools available on the market to date (status 2019) and is able to determine the optimum position and height of the intermediate supports.\r\nThe reason for the more accurate results of the new tool is the assumption that the skyline is anchored at both end points. Forest cable yarders used in Europe have a skyline that is fixed at both ends. The behaviour of fixed-anchored suspension ropes is very difficult to describe mathematically and cannot be solved analytically. For this reason, simplified linearized assumptions have so far been used in the forestry sector, which corresponds to the behaviour of a weight-tensioned suspension rope and is known as the Pestal method (1961). Weight-tensioned suspension ropes are used for passenger transport. \r\nFor the calculation of the load path curve we use an iterative method, which was described by Zweifel (1960) and developed especially for fixed anchored suspension ropes. This makes mathematics much more demanding, but leads to more accurate and realistic results. Since there are no current models which describe the installation costs with adequate accuracy, the solution sought is the one which has a minimum number of supports in the first priority and minimises the support height in the second priority (Figure 2). The presented method is the first one, which starts from a fixed anchored supporting rope and identifies the mathematically optimal column layout at the same time. In contrast to methods that assume a weight-tensioned suspension rope, this approach achieves more realistic solutions with longer spans and lower support heights, which ultimately leads to lower installation costs. Background information on rope mechanics and calculation methods is documented in Bont and Heinimann (2012).\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\nBont, L., & Heinimann, H. R. (2012).

The main focus lies on wood and its embedding/interaction within/with the landscape.\r\n* Conception and development of data acquisition based on high resolution remote sensing data.\r\n* Conception, development and maintenance of the software interface in area wide data acquisition using airborne remote sensing data.\r\n* Scientific expert advice and support in the fields of photogrammetry and survey at WSL. Maintenance, enhancements and future development in these specific fields.\r\n* Adequate presentation of scientific results on national level and in noted international journals and at international congresses/workshops/symposia.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/landscape-dynamics/remote-sensing.html",

            "notes": "The available datasets are snow depth maps with a spatial resolution of 2m generated from image matching of ADS 80/100 data. Image acquisition took place at peak of winter (time when the thickest snowpack is expected). The snow depth maps are the difference of a summer DSM from the winter DSM of the corresponding date . The summer DSM used is a product of image matching of ADS 80 data from summer 2013. In the available products buildings, vegetation and outliers were masked (set to NoData).\r\nFor the elimination of buildings the TLM layer (swisstopo) was used, because this layer might not represent exactly the\r\nstate of infrastructure at time of image acquisition, it is possible that mainly in dense settlement some buildings were not successfully masked. For the relevant area above treeline the masking of buildings showed good results. Vegetation got masked for a height above ground > 1m and was detected in a combination of summer and winter data sets. As Outliers were considered unrealistic snow depths caused by a failure of the image matching algorithm. Snow depths > 15m and smaller than < -15m were classified as outliers. Negative snow depth were kept, because of an uncertainty in image orientation accuracy. It is expected that in regions with negative snow depth also positive snow depth are underestimated by the same amount, which means that an estimation of snow volume should be carried out summing up the absolute values of snow depth (also the negative ones). For volume estimation in small regions the user has to take into account, that orientation accuracy of the images is roughly around 1-2 GSD (30cm), which propagates directly to the snow depth product. Areas which are not covered by snow got assigned a value of 0 as snow depth.\r\n\r\nThe work is published in: \r\n\r\nBühler, Y.; Marty, M.; Egli, L.; Veitinger, J.; Jonas, T.; Thee, P.; Ginzler, C., (2015).

            "notes": "The wind-driven saltation of sand and snow shapes dunes and ripples, generates dust emission, and erodes the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet. Here, we use a model based on the discrete element method to simulate grain-flow interactions and study the effect of particle cohesion on saltation dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe data contains the model output of granular splash simulations and saltation simulations. Granular splash, the main particle entrainment process in saltation, occurs upon impact of saltating particles with the granular bed. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of granular splash for loose sand grains and for cohesive ice grains. The analysis indicate that different values of cohesion have significant effects not on the number of splashed grains, on the ejection velocity, and the rebound velocity.\r\n\r\nIn our saltation simulations, we trigger particle movement with a single splash event at the inlet section section and let the system evolve until steady state. Our results show that saltation over cohesive surfaces is difficult to initiate but easy to sustain at low wind speed. The occurrence of transport thus depends on the history of the wind speed, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. We also show that saltation over cohesive surfaces presents higher mass fluxes but requires longer distances to saturate, which increases the size of the smallest stable surface ripples. Our model results have implications for large-scale aeolian processes on Earth and Titan, where sand grains are thought to be very cohesive.",

What were the relevant actors and what were their motivations? And\r\nwhat can be said about the ecological consequences of this development?\r\n\r\nIn a research project on the history of wetlands in Switzerland since 1700,\r\nwe conducted (a) a historical analysis of the development of land use in\r\nwetlands and the actors involved, (b) a historical-cartographic\r\nreconstruction of wetland extent since 1850 and (c) an evaluation of\r\necological effects of changes in wetlands on various organisms groups.\r\n\r\nThe series of GIS layers on wetland history stem from the second part of\r\nthe project. The area reconstruction is based on digitized and homogenized\r\nsignatures from national map series, as they have been available since\r\nabout 1850.

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

The catchments have a median catchment area of 117 km². The 307 catchments together form a set representative of the climatological conditions and runoff characteristics in Switzerland. The four variables were simulated at a daily resolution using the hydrological model PREVAH. PREVAH is a conceptual process-based model that was run in this study in its fully distributed version on a 500 m grid (Viviroli et al. 2009a). For the calibration, runoff time series from 140 mesoscale catchments covering the different runoff regimes were used. The model calibration was conducted over the period 1993-1997. Verification was performed on the period 1983-2005 using (i) volumetric deviation (Viviroli et al. 2007) and (ii) benchmark efficiency (Schäfli et al 2007) as objective functions. The calibration and validation procedures are described in detail in Köplin et al. (2010). The parameters for each model grid cell were derived by regionalizing the parameters obtained for the 140 catchments with a procedure based on ordinary kriging (Viviroli et al. 2009b, Köplin et al. 2010).\r\nThe calibrated and validated model was then driven with transient meteorological data (precipitation, temperature, radiation, and wind) representing both reference (1981-2017) and future climate conditions (2018-2099). The data were derived from the CH2018 climate scenarios (NCCS 2018) provided by the Swiss National Centre for Climate Services (NCCS). They were obtained from climate experiments produced with different climate modeling chains, consisting of a global and a regional circulation model each, within EUROCORDEX  for three representative concentration pathways (RCP) emission scenarios. Downscaled output of ten climate model chains derived by quantile mapping were considered. The focus was on the chains of the EUR-11 domain with a horizontal resolution of 0.11 degrees (roughly 12.5 km). The climate model chains (GCM, RCM, RCP, and grid resolution) used are listed below:\r\n\r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tDMI-HIRHAM5\t2.6\tEUR-11\r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tDMI-HIRHAM5\t4.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tDMI-HIRHAM5\t8.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tSMHI-RCA4\t2.6\tEUR-11  \r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tSMHI-RCA4\t4.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- ICHEC-EC-EARTH\tSMHI-RCA4\t8.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- MOHC-HadGEM2-ES\tSMHI-RCA4\t4.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- MOHC-HadGEM2-ES\tSMHI-RCA4\t8.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR\tSMHI-RCA4\t4.5\tEUR-11  \r\n- MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR\tSMHI-RCA4\t8.5\tEUR-11  \r\n\r\n__*References*__:\r\n\r\n-\tKöplin, N., D.

                "description": " The Research Unit investigates natural hazard processes in mountainous areas, in particular the triggering and propagation of floods, sediment transport, landslides, debris flows and rock fall. Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

The slope was mainly covered by grass and its lower part was flat and large enough to provide natural runouts of the single trajectories.\r\n\r\nAn extensive measurement program has been set up to measure the block trajectories: With surveyor's instruments the slope and the six used rock blocks were scanned and the start and end positions of each test were recorded. During the single events two cameras filmed the trajectories. A special sensor device located within the blocks recorded the acting accelerations and rotational speeds over time. Further, the device emitted a Wifi signal that got detected from eight receivers around the slope. Based on this signal the block position has been recorded over time. \r\n\r\nThe dataset contains all data that were gathered through above field campaign.",

            "notes": "# Overview\r\n\r\nThe CH2014-Impacts initiative is a concerted national effort to describe impacts of climate change in Switzerland quantitatively, drawing on the scientific resources available in Switzerland today. The initiative links the recently developed Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011 with an evolving base of quantitative impact models. The use of a common climate data set across disciplines and research groups sets a high standard of consistency and comparability of results. Impact studies explore the wide range of climatic changes in temperature and precipitation projected in CH2011 for the 21st century, which vary with the assumed global level of greenhouse gases, the time horizon, the underlying climate model, and the geographical region within Switzerland. The differences among climate projections are considered using three greenhouse gas scenarios, three future time periods in the 21st century, and three climate uncertainty levels (Figure 1). Impacts are shown with respect to the reference period 1980-2009 of CH2011, and add to any impacts that have already emerged as a result of earlier climate change.\r\n\r\n# Experimental Setup\r\n\r\nFuture snow cover changes are simulated with the physics-based model Alpine3D (Lehning et al., 2006). It is applied to two regions: The canton of Graubünden and the Aare catchment. These domains are modeled with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 200 m × 200 m. This defines the simulation grid that has to be filled with land cover data and downscaled meteorological input data for each cell for the time period of interest at hourly resolution. The reference data set consists of automatic weather station data. All meteorological input parameters are spatially interpolated to the simulation grid. The reference period comprises only thirteen years (1999–2012), because the number of available high elevation weather stations for earlier times is not sufficient to achieve unbiased distribution of the observations with elevation. The model uses projected temperature and precipitation changes for all greenhouse gas scenarios (A1B, A2, and RCP3PD) and CH2011 time periods (2035, 2060, and 2085).\r\n\r\n# Data\r\n\r\nSnow cover changes are projected to be relatively small in the near term (2035) (Figure 5.1 top), in particular at higher elevations above 2000 m asl. As shown by Bavay et al. (2013) the spread in projected snow cover for this period is greater between different climate model chains (Chapter 3) than between the reference period and the model chain exhibiting the most moderate change. In the 2085 period much larger changes with the potential to fundamentally transform the snow dominated alpine area become apparent (Figure 5.1 bottom). These changes include a shortening of the snow season by 5–9 weeks for the A1B scenario. This is roughly equivalent to an elevation shift of 400–800 m. The slight increase of winter precipitation and therefore snow fall projected in the CH2011 scenarios (with high associated uncertainty) can no longer compensate for the effect of increasing winter temperatures even at high elevations. In terms of Snow Water Equivalents (SWE), the projected reduction is up to two thirds toward the end of the century (2085). A continuous snow cover will be restricted to a shorter time period and/or to regions at increasingly high elevation. In Bern, for example, the number of days per year with at least 5 cm snow depth will decrease by 90% from now 20 days to only 2 days on average.\r\n",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

Moreover, it provides contributions to protection from natural hazards and to the forest as habitat and recreational area, by covering forest structures and their development.\r\n\r\nAlthough the RU focuses on forests, it also deals with the interaction between forests and other landscape elements. The RU handles its research themes on different spatial levels: from the stand, to the forest enterprise, to the region and up to the national level. Its research has a strong international reach, especially regarding the methods.\r\n\r\nThe RU administers the major project Swiss National Forest Inventory LFI and executes it by statutory mandate and in co-operation with the Federal Office of the Environment FOEN. Substantial parts of the LFI are carried out within the RU, while other parts are processed in co-operation with other RUs.\r\n\r\nThe RU is active in knowledge transfer. Its research projects are usually application-relevant and have an implementation component.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/forest-resources-and-management.html",

            "notes": "Switzerland has a reliable and cost efficient energy system. Due to phase  out of nuclear energy it is necessary to find new options to maintain this powerful energy system. The Swiss energy strategy 2050 aims to reduce CO2-emissions, increase efficiency and promote renewable energies. The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) examined relevant woody and non-woody biomass quantities (cubic meters, fresh-, dry weight) and their energy potentials (in Petajoules: primary energy and biomethane) with a similar methodological approach. The work was done within the frame of the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER) especially in line with the SCCER Biomass for Swiss energy future (Biosweet). With a uniform and consistent approach for the current potentials ten biomass categories were estimated and aggregated for the whole of Switzerland. In this context solutions for the technical, social and political challenges are promoted. First, considering the different biomass resources characteristics and available data, appropriate methods at the finest scale possible were elaborated to estimate the annual quantities which could theoretically be collected (theoretical potential). Then, explicit and rational restrictions for sustainable bio-energy production were defined according to the current state of the art and subtracted from the theoretical potential to obtain the sustainable potential. The main restrictions are competing material utilizations, environmental factors and supply costs. Finally, the additional sustainable potential was estimated considering the current bioenergy production. Our main purpose was to provide potentials for developing conversion technologies as well as a detailed and comprehensive basis of the Swiss biomass potentials for energy use for economic and political decision makers.

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

This theme is derived on the level of a sample plot from the cutting of the sample trees and the salvage cut proportion (according to information from the forester).  *In the calculation no D7/tree height data were used. The values calculated like this have not been corrected for bias, but allow for cantons or forest districts a more robust estimation of changes and could thus be better interpreted. \n\n__Citation:__\n > _Abegg, M.; Brändli, U.-B.; Cioldi, F.; Fischer, C.; Herold-Bonardi, A.; Huber M.; Keller, M.; Meile, R.; Rösler, E.; Speich, S.; Traub, B.; Vidondo, B.

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

This feature is derived on the level of a sample plot from the cutting of the sample trees and the salvage cut proportion (according to information from the forester).  *In the calculation no D7/tree height data were used. The values calculated like this have not been corrected for bias, but allow for cantons or forest districts a more robust estimation of changes and could thus be better interpreted. \n\n__Citation:__\n > _Abegg, M.; Brändli, U.-B.; Cioldi, F.; Fischer, C.; Herold-Bonardi, A.; Huber M.; Keller, M.; Meile, R.; Rösler, E.; Speich, S.; Traub, B.; Vidondo, B.

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

This theme is derived on the level of a sample plot from the cuttings of the sample trees and the salvage cut proportion (according to information from the forester).   The correction for bias with the sample Tarif trees may be so drastic that it results in negative values with small numbers of trees.\n\n__Citation:__\n > _Abegg, M.; Brändli, U.-B.; Cioldi, F.; Fischer, C.; Herold-Bonardi, A.; Huber M.; Keller, M.; Meile, R.; Rösler, E.; Speich, S.; Traub, B.; Vidondo, B.

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

This ensemble accompanies the publication \"The bright side of PV production in snow-covered mountains\", published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and reproduces all results and figures of. Code and resources are in their original form (with documentation). A new version with a more generalized application to PV modelling and with more flexibility in terms of input and output formats will be released in the coming months.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nAll code is written and has to be executed in Matlab. The input and output data sets are also in the Matlab-specific .mat format. Whenever publicly available, the original data is provided as geotif, .xlsx or other common format. \r\nThis is the case for:\r\n\r\n- Digital Elevation Model (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/ASTERDEM), \r\n- Landsurface cover type (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/CORINE), \r\n- Population Density (InputsFromMatlab/MSG/OriginalData/popdensRaster, \r\n- Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/Validation/WSL), \r\n- Measured irradiance for two validation sites (/Validation/ASRB)\r\nThe ‘Metadata’ documents in the respective folders provide further information about the data sources and processing. Figures are produced either in .pdf or .png format. \r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe central level of the SUNWELL environment holds the 5 Mains, which run the different modelling aspects of the paper; each code is documented separately. Additional code is located in the __‘DataProcessing’__ and the __‘functions’__ folder. Functions are called in the different Mains.\r\n\r\n__‘InputsFromMatlab’__ contains the radiation and albedo input data sets in separate subfolders (SIS/SISDIR/ALB). The original data is not publicly available, but can be requested for research purposes free of charge. We provide a processed subset of the data set that was used to run the SUNWELL simulations. The MSG subfolder contains additional spatial input data sets.\r\n\r\n__‘Outputs’__ contains the output files from the different mains (matching names, Main_CHallpixels.m  Prod_CHallpixels)\r\n\r\n__‘Publication_figures’__ contains all individual figures from the PNAS publication, as well as the generating code (/code_plot) and the power point figures (/ppts) that provide the combined final figures.\r\n\r\n__‘Validation’__ contains the data sets used in the model validation:\r\n\r\n- Electricity production from three of our validation sites (/WSL), \r\n- Measured irradiance for two validation sites (/ASRB)\r\n\r\n__Electricity__ production from a validation site at Lac des Toules in Wallis (/LDT), this data set was provided under an NDA and cannot be made publicly available. \r\n\r\n__Paper Citation:__\r\n > _Annelen Kahl; Jérôme Dujardin; Michael Lehning (2018).

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

In 2014 and 2015 we used 11 mobile weather stations from sensorscope to record meteorological parameter in the upper Dischma valley in the closer surroundings of the Gletschboden area. The meteorological stations are eqiupped with at least air temperature/humidity, wind velocity and wind direction sensors. Some stations are additionally equipped with precipitation, shortwave radiation and snow surface temperature sensors.  \r\nThree transects were installed at different aspects and were equipped with air temperature/humidity and wind sensors. Transect 1 (stations 2-4) provides meteorological Information on an east-north-east facing slope at elevations ranging between 2100 m and 2500 m. Transect 2 (stations 5-7) provides meteorological Information on a south-west slope and transect 3 (stations 8-10) on a north-west slope. Station 1 is fully equipped with meteorological sensors (temperature/humidity, wind, IR, up and downwand shortwave radiation and precipitation).\r\nIn 2016, mobile stations from sensorscope were replaced with six permanent meteorological stations. Meteorological stations 1-3 are equipped with an air temperature/humidity sensor, two wind speed sensors, a wind direction sensor and an incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation sensor. Stations 4 and 6 are equipped with an air temperature/humidity sensor and a wind speed/direction sensor. Station 5 is a equipped with an air temperature/humidity sensor, a wind speed/direction sensor, a snow surface temperature sensor, an incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation sensor and an incoming longwave radiation sensor.",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The survey obtains data about trees, stands, sample plots and through enquiries at the local forest service.\r\n\r\nThe NFI carried out by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in collaboration with the Forest Division at Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN ). The WSL is responsible for the planning, survey and analysis, as well as the scientific interpretation and publication of the NFI. The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

The political interpretation and implementation is done by the Forest Division.\r\n\r\nThe first survey (LFI1) took place from 1983–85, the second survey followed in 1993–95 and the third inventory was carried out 2004–2006. Since 2009, the continuous survey of the fourth NFI (2009–2017) has been in progress.\r\n\r\nMore information: https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

Here the longest continuous runoff records (1903 - 2015) from small catchments (less than 1 km2) in Switzerland (and possibly worldwide) are provided as a data set. The history of the hydrological monitoring in the Sperbel- and Rappengraben (Emmental) is summarized in Stähli et al., Environ Monit Assess (2011). The runoff stations operated safely for more than 90% of the summer months when most of the major flood events occurred. Nevertheless, the absolute values of peak runoff during the largest flood events are subject to considerable uncertainty (also discussed in Stähli et al., 2011). This treasure trove of data can be used in various ways, eg. for analysis of the generalized extreme value distributions of the two catchments, of the mechanisms governing the runoff behavior of small catchments, as well as for testing stochastic and deterministic models.

            "notes": "The data correspond to the experiments presented and discussed in a paper regarding the interaction between turbulent wind fluctuations and snow saltation mass-fluxes (Paterna, 2016). Each of the nine data files corresponds to a different experiment presented in the paper and conducted in the winter 2014/2015 in the WSL/SLF cold wind tunnel in Davos. For each file the five columns indicate the time from the beginning of the experiment, the streamwise (u’) and the vertical (w’) wind velocity fluctuations, the streamwise (qx) and the vertical (qz) snow mass-flux components. From these time-series the scales of the snow saltation and of the turbulent flow are obtained with respect to the eddy-cycles and snow saltation cycles. From spectral analysis of the time-series a decoupling of the snow saltation from the turbulence forcing reveals two regimes of interaction: a turbulence-dependent regime occurring with weak saltation, and a turbulence-independent regime with strong saltation.

            "notes": "A landslide testsite dataset related to pore water pressure perturbations on the stability of unsaturated silty sand slopes leading to the initiation and propagation of the shear deformations and eventual rapid mass movements. This project was initiated and led by the Institute of Geotechnical Engineering (IGT) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and was incorporated in a Swiss national (TRAMM) and a European Union (SafeLand) multidisciplinary research project. Field site: The experimental slope is 7.5 m wide by 35 m long, located in the Swiss lowlands on an east facing slope over-looking the river Rhine, at an altitude of ~ 350 masl. Originally there were forestry covertures of circa 80%, heights of 5-20 m. Shrubs up to 1-5 m high and a free herb layer covered ~ 50% of the surface. The average gradient was determined to be from 38° to 43° with a slightly concave surface. The underlying rock consists mainly of Molasse, which is formed by alternate layers of sea deposits under the Tethys Sea (Seawater Molasse) and land deposits (Freshwater Molasse). Several augured samples, as well as an outcrop of the bedrock about 20 m above the selected field, revealed horizontal layering of fine grained sand- and marlstone at the test site. The sandstone was later proven to be highly permeable and fissured. Grain-size distributions were determined and the soil was classified as medium-low plasticity silty sand. Site instrumentation:Measurements of soil suction, groundwater level, soil volumetric water content, rain intensity and soil temperature were taken and combined with geophysical monitoring using Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) and investigations into subsurface flow by means of tracer experiments. Deformations were monitored during the experiment, both on the surface via photogrammetrical methods and within the soil mass, using a flexible probe equipped with strain gauges at different points and two axis inclinometers on the top and acoustic sensors. Instruments were installed mainly in three clusters at depths of 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm below the ground surface over the slope, including jet-fill tensiometers, TDRs, Decagon TDRs, piezometers, soil temperature sensors, deformation probes, earth pressure cells, acoustic sensors and rain gauges. A ring-net barrier (provided by Geobrugg AG) was set up at the foot of the slope to protect the road. Experiments: A sprinkling experiment was carried out in September 2008 to investigate the hydrological and mechanical response of the slope (Experiment 1), followed by a second one to trigger a landslide in March 2009 (Experiment 2). \r\n\r\n__Publications__\r\n\r\n1.

Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

Here we provide daily mean values; values in sub-daily resolution can be provided on demand.\r\nRunoff has been measured at the outlet of three small (first-order) catchments of approximately 1 km2 area: Erlenbach (two independent runoff measurements), Vogelbach and Lümpenenbach. The catchments are similar with regard to geology (Flysch) and soil conditions (clay soils), but differ in forest coverage (20 to 60%). A detailed description of the catchments can be found at https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/naturgefahren-anlagen/wildbachforschung-im-alptal/gebietsbeschreibung.html.\r\nRunoff in these small catchments is typically very dynamic and can temporally carry large amounts of sediment and large wood. Thus, the accuracy of the measurements at very large flow is limited. \r\nMeteorological variables have been measured on a meadow (Erlenhöhe) located in the Erlenbach catchment at 1220 m a.s.l. using a standard meteorological station (incl. ventilated air temperature and heated rain gauges). In addition, precipitation has also been recorded at two other locations (in the Vogelbach and Lümpenenbach catchments).\r\nSnow measurements have been conducted weekly to monthly since 1968 at more than 15 locations (30-m transects) representing different altitudes, aspects and land uses (meadow, forest).

Therefore, observations of treeline patterns are more likely to be obscured by historical land use than in regions with less human influence and might not provide relevant information about environmental factors that influence mortality and growth patterns at the natural high-elevation limit of tree existence. To overcome this, we used a large afforestation experiment in the Swiss Alps, \"Stillberg\", to address the following questions:\r\n\r\nCan trees survive above the current treeline in the European Alps? Are environmental factors that influence spatial patterns of mortality the same as those that influence height growth? Does the relative importance of these environmental variables change over the first 40 years after planting as seedlings?\r\n\r\n#Dataset\r\nThe 5 ha Stillberg long-term afforestation research area is located near Davos (Central Alps, Switzerland). The bottom of the afforestation is approximately at the current treeline and it covers an altitudinal gradient of more than 150 m (2075 to 2230 m a.s.l.; see picture above). Approximately 92'000 seedlings of three treeline species (Larix decidua, Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata and Pinus cembra) were systematically planted in 1975, and mortality and height growth were closely monitored during the following 40 years.\r\n\r\n__Publications__\r\nBarbeito, I., Dawes, M.

The test site below the building is the [SLF's](http://www.envidat.ch/organization/slf) oldest and equipped with numerous measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n## Globally unrivalled serial measurements\r\nIn autumn 1936, the Expert Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research (now the SLF) in Switzerland built the first snow laboratory on the Weissfluhjoch. Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",

These include often long lasting snow cover, short growing seasons and topographically related disturbances such as avalanches, rockfall or landslides.Mountain ecosystems and inhabiting animal and plant species are generally well adapted to these conditions. However, they may react sensitively to changes of climate, land-use and disturbance regimes. Activities of the group focus on mountain ecosystems above and below the treeline (mountain forest, alpine ecosystems) and represent links between ecosystem research of WSL and snow and avalanche topics of the SLF in Davos.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/community-ecology/mountain-ecosystems.html",

            "notes": "# Overview\r\nHigh elevation ecosystems are important in research about environmental change because shifts in climate associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to be more pronounced in these areas than in most other regions of the world. This project involves a Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) and soil warming experiment located in a natural treeline environment near Davos, Switzerland (Stillberg, 2200 m a.s.l.). Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (+200 ppm) were applied from 2001 to 2009, and a soil warming treatment (+4 K) was added in 2007 (ongoing). The combined CO2 enrichment and warming treatment reflects conditions expected to occur in this region in approximately 2050. A broad range of ecological and biogeochemical research is carried out as part of this environmental change project.\r\n\r\n#Experimental setup\r\nThe experiment consists of 40 hexagonal 1.1 m2 plots, 20 with a Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata (mountain pine, evergreen) individual in the centre and 20 with a Larix decidua (European larch, deciduous) individual in the centre. A dense cover of understorey vegetation surrounds the tree in each plot, including the dominant dwarf shrub species Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium gaultherioides (group V. uliginosum agg., northern bilberry) and Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum (crowberry) plus several herbaceous and non-vascular species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the experimental period, the 40 plots were assigned to 10 groups of four neighbouring plots (two larch and two pine trees per group) in order to facilitate the logistics of CO2 distribution and regulation. Half of these groups were randomly assigned to an elevated CO2 treatment while the remaining groups served as controls and received no additional CO2. In spring 2007, one plot of each tree species identity was randomly selected from each of the 10 CO2 treatment groups and assigned a soil warming treatment, yielding a balanced design with a replication of five individual plots for each combination of CO2 level, warming treatment and tree species.\r\n\r\n#Data\r\nSoil and air conditions have been monitored closely throughout the study period, with most measurements made during the combined CO2 x warming experiment (2007-2009).

We used the stereo aerial images acquired by the Federal Office of Topography swisstopo using the ADS80 sensor to first calculate a digital surface model (DSM) with a very high spatial resolution (1 × 1 m). The DSM was then normalized to obtain the actual vegetation heights using the digital terrain model (DTM) SwissAlti3D based on airborne laser data. Buildings are masked out using the NDVI information of the aerial images to produce a vegetation height model, and to produce a vegetation height model (VHM). Such a model will be calculated in the framework of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) with consistent methods and a very high level of detail. For covering the whole of Switzerland, we used summer aerial images from 2011 to 2016.",

            "notes": "Meteorological and soil moisture measurements from soil moisture stations installed from October 2010 - October 2013 in the area surrounding Davos, in particular in the Dischma catchment.\r\n\r\nThere are in total 7 stations: 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 222, 333 and SLF2. For each of the stations, there is a:\r\n\r\n* vwc_[stn].smet: containing the soil moisture measurements\r\n\r\n* station_[stn].smet: in-situ measured meteorlogical parameters. Note, the quality of these measurements for stations 1202, 1203, 1204 and 1205 is very low, with data gaps. Use this data with care. For stations 222, 333 and SLF2, data quality is high and only the default cautiousness should be applied.\r\n\r\n* interpolatedmeteo_[stn].smet contains per stations a dataset derived by interpolating from several stations in the Davos area to the stations location. This dataset was generated from the output of the Alpine3D model, of which simulations are presented in the Wever et al. (2017) manuscript.\r\n\r\nAt the soil moisture measurement sites, Decagon 10HS sensors were installed, at 10, 30, 50, 80 and 120 cm depth. Per depth 2 sensors were installed, labelled A and B in the datafiles. Note that at stations 1203, 1204 and 1205, sensors were only installed at 10, 30 and 50 cm depth.\r\n\r\nThe files follow the SMET format: https://models.slf.ch/docserver/meteoio/SMET_specifications.pdf and metadata for the stations can be found in the header of the smet files.\r\n\r\nPlease cite the Wever et al. (2017) reference when using this data in publications.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed description, please refer to: Wever, N., Comola, F., Bavay, M., and Lehning, M.: Simulating the influence of snow surface processes on soil moisture dynamics and streamflow generation in an alpine catchment, Hydrol.

                    "description": "We drilled six boreholes in two clusters. The boreholes reached a depth between 2 and 9 m below the ground surface. The lower half of boreholes BH1 and BH6 were cored with a 9 cm-diameter rotational diamond drilling head. The other boreholes were drilled destructively with an 11 cm-diameter Mitsubishi hammer system. Boreholes BH1, BH2 and BH5 were equipped with open standpipe piezometers, whereas BH3, BH4 and BH6 were equipped with a special piezometer system composed of an enclosed measuring cell at the bottom of a 1 inch-PVC tube. The free groundwater level in the PVC tube is measured in the standpipe piezometer, but it doesn’t necessarily represent the water table in the soil layer because the pressure sensor is located in the sealed lower part of the piezometer in the enclosed measuring cell and thus is not in contact with the air. This system allows the hydraulic pressure of lithologies with low permeability to be measured directly. Two piezometers were installed in BH6 at different depths. The PVC tubes were slotted at the bottom for 0.5, 1 or 2 meters and the boreholes were sealed carefully with clay pellets above this filter section to avoid by-pass and infiltration from the surface. DCX-22 pressure sensors from Keller AG Winterthur, with integrated data loggers, were installed in each piezometer to measure the relative hydraulic pressure at a 30 minute-intervals from November 2010 to November 2011. The data were corrected for in-situ air-pressure fluctuations.",

            "notes": "Rufiberg is a pre-alpine meadow site in Switzerland where shallow landslides have been observed after past intense rain storms. In order to assess the triggering mechanisms of these landslides, a comprehensive investigation was conducted within the project TRAMM from Nov 2009 to Oct 2012. It included meteorological observations, soil moisture measurements, bedrock groundwater measurements. The Rufiberg is located at the NW side of the Gnipen to the north of the village Arth-Goldau in the Canton of Schwyz. In the summer months, the site is used for pasturing. Usually, from December to March a snow cover is present at the Rufiberg. The site is at an altitude between 1080 – 1180 m asl, is ENE oriented, and has an average slope of 30 -35°. The Subalpine Molasse in the region is inclined with 30 - 35° to SE. In the area of the field site, beds of conglomerate with several m of thickness alter with beds of sandstone and marlstone. A ca. 2 – 5 m thick eluvium/colluvium layer composed of silty and sandy clay covers the bedrock. This site has been chosen because on one hand, during heavy rainfall events, e.g. autumn 2005, numerous landslides occur in the region of the Gnipen and the Rufiberg. On the other hand, the Rufiberg is very appropriate for experiments due its location away from infrastructures and due to its accessibility. The goal of the investigation was to understand the hydrology and hydrogeology of the slope with regard to shallow landslides. \r\n\r\nMore information: Brönnimann, C., Stähli, M., Schneider, P., Seward, L. and Springman, S.M. 2013.

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

Measurements were taken from two turbulence towers over a long-lasting snow patch, which are 5 m apart from each other (2014 and 2015). The turbulence towers were equipped with two YOUNG ultrasonic anemometers mounted 0.7 m (in 2014) and 3.3 m (in 2015) above snow-free ground, two ultrasonic anemometers (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) mounted at 2.6 m (in 2014) and 2.2 m (in 2015) above snow-free ground and one anemometer (DA-600, Kaijo Denki) mounted at 0.3 m above snow surface.  \r\n\r\nThe measurement setup changed in 2016 and includes a measurement above the snow-free ground in upwind direction (Swiss coordinates: 790191/176689). The measurement tower is equipped with one ultrasonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) in 3.3 m above the snow-free ground. Additionally, one measurement tower is installed above the long-Lasting snow patch and equipped with the same setup as 2015.\r\n\r\nTurbulence data were sampled at a frequency of 20 Hz. The processing of the data to quality controlled fluxes has been done with the Biomicrometeorology flux software (Thomas et al., 2009). The program applies plausibility tests and a despiking test after Vickers and Mahrt (1997) on the measured data. The routine further applies a time-lag correction and considers the deployment (e.g.  the sonic azimuth). A frequency response correction (Moore, 1986) is done and a three-dimensional rotation is performed. Finally, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) flags after Foken et al., (2004) are issued and fast Fourier transform power and co-spectra are calculated.  The change in snow height is considered in the post-processing for every measurement day. The turbulence data were averaged to 30 minute intervals. ",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

            "notes": "We recorded snow ablation maps with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS, Riegl-VZ6000) at the Gletschboden area. The TLS position is located approximately 30 vertical meters above the Gletschboden area at a northerly exposed slope. In total 44 TLS measurement sets have been conducted in three consecutive years 2014-2016 (2014: 13 measurements; 2015: 17 measurements; 2016: 14 measurements). The TLS system has a single-point measurement frequency of 300 kHz and a beam divergence of 0.007°. This set-up allows a horizontal resolution of approximately 0.01 m in 100 m distance to the TLS position. One scan of the Gletschboden area lasts approximately 15 minutes. The travel time from the laser scanner towards the surface is recorded and afterwards converted into a point cloud of distances. 5 reflectors located at the Gletschboden area and in the closer surroundings were additionally scanned during each measurement to transform the point cloud from the scanner own coordinate system into Swiss coordinates. Additionally, orthophotos have been created by using pictures recorded from the TLS in order to provide snow mask maps. Snow and bare ground can be distinguished by the RGB color information of the orthophoto. Cells with blue band information greater than 175 were categorized as snow and all cells with values smaller or equal 175 were categorized as bare ground. ",

Here we present an experimental study on the effect on the snow isotopic composition by airflow through a snow pack in controlled laboratory conditions. The influence of isothermal and controlled temperature gradient conditions on the δ18O content in the snow and interstitial water vapor is elucidated. The observed disequilibrium between snow and vapor isotopes led to exchange of isotopes between snow and vapor under non-equilibrium processes, significantly changing the δ18O content of the snow. The type of metamorphism of the snow had a significant influence on this process. \r\nEbner, P. P., Steen-Larsen, H.

We used the cells at which stations are present, calculated the bias between the annual accumulations and the GPCC climatology, and used a multilevel B-spline interpolation of the biases to a 0.25 grid to create the bias surface. This bias surface was then multiplied with the mean annual precipitation sums to create the final climatologies.",

            "notes": "High-resolution information on climatic conditions is essential to many applications in environmental and ecological sciences. Here we present the CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) data of downscaled model output temperature and precipitation estimates of the ERA-Interim climatic reanalysis to a high resolution of 30 arc sec. The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.\r\n\r\nData Variable Codes:\r\n\r\n- Bio1 = Annual Mean Temperature\r\n- Bio2 = Mean Diurnal Range\r\n- Bio3 = Isothermality\r\n- Bio4 = Temperature Seasonality\r\n- Bio5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month\r\n- Bio6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month\r\n- Bio7 = Temperature Annual Range\r\n- Bio8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter\r\n- Bio9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter\r\n- Bio10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter\r\n- Bio11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter\r\n- Bio12 = Annual Precipitation\r\n- Bio13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month\r\n- Bio14 = Precipitation of Driest Month\r\n- Bio15 = Precipitation Seasonality\r\n- Bio16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter\r\n- Bio17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter\r\n- Bio18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter\r\n- Bio19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n__Paper Citation:__\r\n > _Karger DN. et al.

Process studies on the scale of slopes, channels and catchments form the basis for the development of simulation models and of hazard assessment procedures and for the design of countermeasures. To this end worldwide unique observation systems are developed, such as a debris flow balance and geophone systems for bedload transport. Damage and damaging processes due to frequent and extreme events are assessed as prerequisites for the risk-based and sustainable management of natural hazards.\r\n\r\nA second focus of the unit is on the estimation and prediction of snow and water resources, e.g. for hydropower production or early recognition of drought. The unit operates a snow hydrological service for federal and cantonal agencies and a drought information platform for a broad range of water users.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/mountain-hydrology.html",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

            "notes": "# Abstract\r\nSnow and hydrological modeling in alpine environments remains a challenge because of the complexity of the processes complexity affecting the mass and energy balance. This study examines the influence of snowmelt on the hydrological response of a high-alpine catchment of 43.2 km2 in the Swiss Alps during the water year 2014-2015. Based on recent advances in Alpine3D, we examine how modeled snow distributions, and modeled liquid water transport within the snowpack influence runoff dynamics. By combining these results with multi-scale field data (snow lysimeter data, distributed snow depths and streamflow), we demonstrate the added value of a more realistic representation of snow distribution at the onset of melt season. At the site scale, snowpack runoff is well simulated when the snowpack mass balance errors are corrected (R2 = 0.95 vs. R2 = 0.61). At the sub-basin scale, a more heterogeneous snowpack leads to a more rapid runoff pulse originated in the shallower areas while an extended melting period (by more than a month) is caused by slower snowmelt from deeper areas. This result is a marked improvement over results obtained using a less heterogeneous snow distribution (i.e., traditional precipitation interpolation method). Catchment hydrological response is also improved by the more realistic representation of snowpack heterogeneity (Nash coefficient of 0.85 vs. 0.74), even though the calibration process smoothens out the differences. \r\nThe added value of a more complex liquid water transport scheme is obvious at the site scale but decreases at the sub-basin and basin scales. Our results highlight not only the importance but also the difficulty of getting a realistic snowpack distribution even in a well-instrumented area and present a model validation from multi-scale experimental datasets.",

In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

It describes the hourly power output a 1MW turbine would produce in each 0.01° grid cell for the years 2016 and 2017.\r\n\r\n100 m wind speed data was taken from the COSMO-1 model (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling 2017), which has a 0.01° horizontal resolution. The domain covered is the whole of Switzerland, with the exclusion of lakes. As such, the number of 0.01◦ pixels within Switzerland amounts to 48657. \r\nConversion to power output was done based on the power curve of the Enercon E82 Turbine. As power output is lower at altitude due to lower air density, we corrected for this effect as described in (Kruyt et al. 2017). \r\n\r\nPlease cite the following paper in connection with the dataset:\r\n\r\n__Paper Citation:__\r\n > _Bert Kruyt, Jérôme Dujardin, and Michael Lehning: Improvement of wind power assessment in complex terrain: The case of COSMO-1 in the Swiss Alps, Front.

Nowadays, snow depth distribution is usually estimated by combining point measurements from weather stations or observers in the field with spatial interpolation algorithms. However, even a dense measurement network is not able to capture the large spatial variability of snow depth in alpine terrain. \r\nRemote sensing methods, such as laser scanning or digital photogrammetry, have recently been successfully applied to map snow depth variability at local and regional scales. However, such data acquisition is costly, if manned airplanes are involved. The effectiveness of ground-based measurements on the other hand, is often hindered by occlusions, due to the complex terrain or acute viewing angles. In this paper, we investigate the application of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), in combination with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, to map snow depth distribution. Such systems have the advantage that they are comparatively cost-effective and can be applied very flexibly to cover also otherwise inaccessible terrain. In this study we map snow depth at two different locations: a) a sheltered location at the bottom of the Flüela valley (1900 m a.s.l.) and b) an exposed location (2500 m a.s.l.) on a peak in the ski resort Jakobshorn, both in the vicinity of Davos, Switzerland. At the first test site, we monitor the ablation on three different dates. We validate the photogrammetric snow depth maps using simultaneously acquired manual snow depth measurements. The resulting snow depth values have a root mean square error (RMSE) better than 0.07 to 0.15 m on meadows and rocks and a RMSE better than 0.30 m on sections covered by bushes or tall grass. This new measurement technology opens the door for efficient, flexible, repeatable and cost effective snow depth monitoring for various applications, investigating the worlds cryosphere.\r\n",

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

            "notes": "Location of data collection\r\nThe Swiss National Park (SNP) is located in the southeastern part of Switzerland, and covers an area of 170 km2, 50 km2 of which is forested, 33 km2 is occupied by alpine and 3 km2 by subalpine grasslands. Elevations range from 1350 to 3170 m a.s.l., and mean annual precipitation and temperature are 871 mm and 0.6°C measured at the Park’s weather station in Buffalora (1980 m a.s.l.) between 1960 and 2009 (MeteoSchweiz 2011). Founded in 1914, the SNP received minimal human disturbance for almost 100 years (no hunting, fishing, or camping, visitors are not allowed to leave the trails). Large (> 1 ha) homogeneous patches of short- and tall-grass vegetation characterize the subalpine grasslands. The average vegetation height of short-grass vegetation is 2 to 5 cm. Red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), quaking grass (Briza media L.) and common bent grass (Agrostis tenuis Sipthrob) are the predominating plant species in this vegetation type. Tussocks of evergreen sedge (Carex sempervirens Vill.) and mat grass (Nardus stricta L.) are predominant in the tall-grass vegetation, which averages 20 cm in vegetation height (Schütz and others 2006). Short-grass vegetation developed in areas where cattle and sheep rested (high nutrient input) during agricultural land-use (from 14th century until 1914); tall-grass vegetation developed in areas where cattle and sheep used to graze, but did not rest (Schütz and others 2003, 2006). Herbivores were shown to consume > 60% of the biomass in short-grass compared to < 20% in tall-grass vegetation (Schütz and others 2006). The herbivore community present in the SNP can be divided into four groups based on body size/weight: large [red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) and chamois (Rupricapra rupricapra L.); 30 - 150 kg], medium [marmot (Marmota marmota L.) and snow hare (Lepus timidus L.); 3 – 6 kg], and small vertebrate herbivores (small rodents: e.g. Clethrionomys spp., Microtus spp., Apodemus spp.; 30 – 100 g) as well as invertebrates (e.g. grasshoppers, caterpillars, cicadas, < 5 g). \r\n\r\nExperimental design\r\nWe selected 18 subalpine grassland sites (9 short-grass, 9 tall-grass vegetation). The sites were spread across the entire park on dolomite parent material at altitudes of 1975 to 2300 meters. At each site we established an exclosure network (fences) in spring 2009 (early June), immediately after snowmelt. Each exclosure network consisted of a total of five 2 × 3 m sized plots that progressively excluded the different herbivores listed above (further labeled according to the herbivore guilds that had access to the respective plots “All”, “Marmot/Mice/Invertebrates”, “Mice/Invertebrates”, “Invertebrates”, “None”). The “All” treatment was thus accessible to all herbivores, was not fenced and was located at least 5 m away from a 2.1 m tall and 7 × 9 m main fence that enclosed the other four treatments. This fence was constructed of 10 × 10 cm wooden posts and electrical equestrian tape (AGRARO ECO, Landi, Bern, Switzerland; 20 mm width) mounted at 0.7 m, 0.95 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m and 2.1 m above the ground that were connected to a solar charged battery (AGRARO Sunpower S250, Landi, Bern, Switzerland). We also mounted non-electrically charged equestrian tape at 0.5 m to help exclude deer and chamois, yet allow marmots and hares to enter safely. Within each main fenced area we randomly established four 2 × 3 m plots: (1) The “Marmot/Mice/Invertebrates” plot remained unfenced, thus, with the exception of red deer and chamois, all herbivores were able to access the plot, (2) The “Mice/Invertebrates” plot consisted of a 90 cm high electric sheep fence (AGRARO Weidezaunnetz ECO, Landi, Bern, Switzerland; mesh size 10 × 10 cm) connected to the solar panel and excluded all medium sized mammals (marmots, hares), but provided access for small mammals and invertebrates, (3) The “Invertebrates” plot provided access for invertebrates only and was surrounded by 1 m high metal mesh (Hortima AG, Hausen, Schweiz; mesh size 2 × 2 cm), (4) The “None” plot was surrounded by a 1 m tall mosquito net (Sala Ferramenta AG, Biasca, Switzerland; mesh size 1.5 × 2 mm) to exclude all herbivores. This plot was covered with a roof constructed of a wooden frame lined with mosquito mesh that was mounted on the wooden corner posts. We also treated this plot with a biocompatible insecticide (Clean kill original, Eco Belle GmbH, Waldshut-Tiengen, Germany) when needed to remove insects that might have entered during data collection or that hatched from the soil. \r\n\r\n!!! The here published data set only contains data for “All”, and “Marmot/Mice/Invertebrates” (= ungulates excluded) plots !!!\r\n\r\nData collection\r\nIn-situ soil CO2 emissions were measured with a PP-Systems SRC-1 soil respiration chamber (closed circuit) attached to a PP-Systems EGM-4 infrared gas analyzer (PP-Systems, Amesbury, MA, USA) on two randomly selected locations on one subplot within each of the 90 plots. For each measurement the soil chamber (15 cm high; 10 cm diameter) was placed on a permanently installed PVC collar (10 cm diameter) driven five centimeters into the soil at the beginning of the study (June 2009). The measurements were conducted between 0900 and 1700 hours every two weeks from early to early September 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013. Freshly germinated plants growing within the PVC collars were removed prior to each measurement to avoid measuring plant respiration/photosynthesis. The two measurements collected per plot every two weeks were averaged. \r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge the funding of the study: funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, SNF grant-no 31003A_122009/1 to Anita C.

            "notes": "In 2013–2014, a survey was conducted in Switzerland to update the Forest Access Roads geo-dataset within the framework of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). The resulting nationwide dataset contains valuable information on truck-accessible forest roads that can be used to transport wood. The survey involved interviewing staff from the approximately 800 local forest services in Switzerland and recording the data first on paper maps and then in digitized form. The data in the NFI on the forest roads could thus be updated and additional information regarding their trafficability for specific categories of truck included. The information has now been attached to the geometries of the Roads and Tracks of the swissTLM3D (release 2012) of the Federal Office of Topography swisstopo. The resulting data are suitable for statistical analyses and modeling, but further (labour-intensive) validation work would be necessary if they are to be used as a basis for applications requiring more spatial accuracy, such as navigation systems. The data are managed at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) and are available for third parties for non-commercial use provided they have purchased a TLM license. \r\n\r\n__Related Publication__: [doi: 10.3188/szf.2016.0136](http://dx.doi.org/10.3188/szf.2016.0136)",

            "notes": "This data set provides estimates of annual fresh water fluxes related to sea-ice formation from ocean freezing and snow-ice formation, sea-ice melting, lateral transport of sea ice in the Southern Ocean over the period 1982 to 2008.It is derived from a mass balance calculation of local sea-ice volume change and divergence from satellite data and sea-ice reconstructions. The mass balance is calculated on a daily basis and fluxes are then integrated over the entire year, where a year is defined from March to February of the next year (i.e. from March 1982 to February 2009). This approach combines multiple products of sea-ice concentration (Cavalieri & Parkinson, 2008;Comiso, 1986; Meier et al., 2013), sea-ice thickness (Kurtz & Markus, 2012; Massonnet et al., 2013; Worby et al., 2008), and sea-ice drift (Fowler et al., 2013; Kwok 2005; Schwegmann et al., 2011). For a detailed description of the method see Haumann et al. (2016). The data set is derived to estimate large-scale (regional to basin-scale) fluxes on an annual basis. Our confidence is reduced on a grid cell basis, such as for single coastal polynyas, where the method and underlying data induce large, unknown uncertainties.\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer: This data set is free to use for any non-commercial purpose at the risk of the user and the authors do not take any liability on the use of the data set.

            "notes": "Silvopastoral systems are highly productive and combine long-term wood production with annual provision of forage for livestock. In the Swiss Jura Mountains these systems are a key component of the landscape. As in other cold biomes, climate change can potentially accelerate landscape change within these historically sustainable systems.\r\n\r\nIn order to anticipate the evolution of subalpine wooded pasture ecosystems under future climate and land-use changes, this project focused on the interplay between soil, vegetation and climate. It was aimed at providing experimental evidence for chief ecosystem processes, with emphasis on the quality of the ecosystem services provided. The main interest was placed on vegetation turf resistance to climate change along an unwooded – sparsely wooded - densely wooded pasture gradient (land-use intensity), where plant productivity, diversity and succession along with rates of carbon cycling and microbial activity provided measures of ecosystem functioning at both plot and landscape level.\r\n\r\nExperimental transplantation of monolith soil turfs to lower altitudes allowed to simulate soil warming and reduced annual precipitation. In order to simulate a year-round warmer and drier climate the natural climate variation along an altitudinal gradient was used as a proxy. The aim was to simulate realistic climate change scenarios for the second half of the 21st century predicted by the IPCC report and downscaled for Switzerland providing regionalized interpolated projections integrating therein trends for temperature increase and precipitation decrease. By using permanent meteorological stations within the network of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss), we obtained high resolution regional data on the variation of mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) in relation to altitude in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We observed a general increase of +0.5 K in MAT and a decrease of -20 % MAP for each 100 m decrease in altitude along the SE slope of the Swiss Jura Mountains. These relationships served for the selection of the transplantation sites such that in comparison to a control site at 1350 m a.s.l. (Combe des Amburnex, N 46°54’, E 6°23’) a +2 K MAT and -20 % MAP was achieved at 1010 m a.s.l. (Saint-George, N 46°52’, E 6°26’), a +4 K MAT and -40 % MAP at 570 m a.s.l., (Arboretum d’Aubonne, N 46°51’, E 6°37’), and a +5 K MAT and -50 % MAP at 395 m a.s.l. (Les Bois Chamblard, N 46°47’, E 6°41’). The two stations at 1010 m a.s.l. and 570 m a.s.l. corresponded to the IPCC scenario A1B for a moderate increase in greenhouse gas emissions and to scenario A2 for a high increase in greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. The station at 395 m a.s.l. was chosen to represent an extreme scenario with climate variables lying at the positive tail distribution of model predictions under the A2 scenario.\r\n\r\nSoil cores were assembled into rectangular PVC boxes of 60  80 cm2 size and of 35 cm height. All mesocosms were dug down to surface level into previously prepared trenches in the ground thus preventing lateral heat exchange with the atmosphere. Since at each site the mesocosms were placed in a common garden with no light interception, mesocosms with turfs from the two wooded pastures were shaded from direct sun light to simulate the natural light conditions in the corresponding habitats. Each mesocosm was equipped with a drainage system and was connected to a water tank thus representing a zero potential lysimeter collecting soil solution and precipitation/snowmelt runoff. ECH2O EC-TM sensor probes coupled to Em50 data-loggers (Decagon Devices, Inc., USA) recorded soil temperature and volumetric water content in each mesocosm at the top-soil (0 to -3 cm) every minute and data were averaged over one hour intervals. Climate parameters at each transplantation site were monitored continuously throughout the experiment by means of automated weather stations (Sensor Scope Sàrl, Switzerland), measuring rain precipitation (non-heated tipping bucket gauges) and air temperature and humidity 2 m above the ground surface at one minute intervals.\r\n\r\nA list of above- and belowground variables were measured to assess the resilience of biogeochemical processes, plant productivity, tree regeneration, and carbon sequestration for each respective land-use practice. Furthermore, the experimental data were used to improve on (parameterization) the existing spatially explicit, dynamic model WoodPaM and refine the modelʼs climatic and land-use variables so that different scenarios of climate change and land use change could be simulated. Natural and management induced disturbance patterns were incorporated into the model. \r\nThe data have been made available within the project CCES Mounted. The climate stations Sensorscope are still in use within the project CLIMARBRE (Wald und Klimawandel, WSL/BAFU).\r\n\r\n#References\r\n\r\n1.

At his WSL side, Prof. Michael Lehning is head of the research unit \"Snow and Permafrost\" at SLF in Davos.\r\n \r\n###General Mission\r\nThe laboratory of cryospheric sciences investigates the processes that shape snow and ice in mountains and polar regions. In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/",

The post-processing steps include the registration of the individual scans into a single 3-dimensional point cloud, the removal of unwanted noise caused by particles in the air (i.e., snow crystals), and the final generation of surface grids based on the cleaned individual point returns. The final product includes the ‘xyz’ coordinates of the individual point measurements, and gridded surfaces covering study areas of 100m x 100 m, and at resolutions of 0.01 m, 0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m and 1 m for each of the survey dates. Additionally, subgrid statistics that include the mean elevation, standard deviation, minimum and maximum elevations, range, and number of point returns in each gridcell are generated.

Relevant features are acquired to describe changes in landscape and land resources at different levels using image data. Mathematical-statistical methods are adopted for automatic detection and description of image objects. Thus we contribute concepts, methods and data to describe/detect area wide changes and processes in the resources of landscape.\r\n\r\n### Tasks and main research\r\n\r\n* Development and application of methods to extract natural objects from continuous data.\r\n* Development of methods for a comprehensive description of natural and anthropogenetic boundaries in continuous pattern (e.g. map signatures, vegetation transition, forest borders).\r\n* Development and application of methods to extract 3D-information from remotely sensed data for description of natural structures and changes. The main focus lies on wood and its embedding/interaction within/with the landscape.\r\n* Conception and development of data acquisition based on high resolution remote sensing data.\r\n* Conception, development and maintenance of the software interface in area wide data acquisition using airborne remote sensing data.\r\n* Scientific expert advice and support in the fields of photogrammetry and survey at WSL. Maintenance, enhancements and future development in these specific fields.\r\n* Adequate presentation of scientific results on national level and in noted international journals and at international congresses/workshops/symposia.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/landscape-dynamics/remote-sensing.html",

The data available is a raster of 25 m x 25 m with the fraction of broadleaf trees. The classification approach incorporates a random forest classifier, explanatory variables from multispectral aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, digitized training polygons and independent validation data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI). Whereas high model overall accuracies (0.99)\r\nand kappa (0.98) were achieved, the comparison of the tree type map with independent NFI data revealed significant deviations that are related to underestimations of broadleaved trees (median of 3.17%).",
